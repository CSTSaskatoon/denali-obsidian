# Prepare Project Analysis
### 4.1 Describe Use Case Diagrams
Actors can be used to drive conversation about requirements
#### Use Case Diagram
Part of UML
Purpose
- Graphical Representation of the users/actors of the system
- Graphical representation of the actions those users perform, or the functionality they rely on
- Representation of the hierarchy of those features and requirements
#### Use Case Components
Not used for actual code, more to get the bigger picture of the project
Use case diagrams are very simple, they contain
- Actors (Stick figures) - Represent Entities preforming some action using the system
- Use Cases (Ovals) - Represent the functions the actors perform when using the system
- Associations (Lines) - Represent interactions between actors and use cases
- System Boundary box - Boundaries of the system, enclosing the use cases which are part of the system and excluding those which are not

##### Things to note
Actors aren't just people - they can also be organizations or external systems
Actors aren't specific people, but rather roles
one person can be performing multiple roles
A use case is functionality that provides something of measurable value to an actor
The UML use case diagram is not the only way to represent use cases
