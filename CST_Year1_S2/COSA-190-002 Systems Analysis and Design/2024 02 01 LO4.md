### 4.7 Design acceptance tests from Use Case Diagrams and User Stories
*Normal Cases* - (success cases) Typical functioning of the system
*Exception Cases* - Error conditions that may occur. Need to ensure the system is robust enough to handle errors without behaving abnormally
*Boundary Cases* - It is important to test values right at the edge of being valid. Quite a few software errors occur at the boundary of valid/not valid
#### Non-behavioural Requirements
*Load* - Also known as stress tests. A test that puts the system under extreme conditions to ensure it can operate in those conditions
*Soak* - A test that puts the system under an average load for a long period of time. Ex.: Simulate an average of 50-70 employees logging in and performing a standard task, such as viewing or updating their vehicle's license plate. These tests can be helpful in locating errors such as memory leaks or concurrency issues
#### Designing Business Level Acceptance Tests (Acceptance Criteria)
Business level acceptance tests are intended to simply define when a story or feature can be considered "done"
Good acceptance criteria will:
- Express intent  
- Reference other project documentation, rather than repeating it.
- Be high level
- Refer to both functional (behavior) and non-functional requirements.
A commonly used place to start acceptance criteria is to simply ask the customer under what conditions they would consider a given feature complete
It's important to get requirements from multiple different stakeholders that have different viewpoints
A manager will think of different things than a security guard
#### Acceptance Test Procedures
Each Acceptance test procedure identifies
- *What preconditions must exist* (setup) - be very specific
- *What steps must be performed* (actions) - every activity that is repeatable
- *Expected outcome* (inspect and validate) - how to check the effects/outcome and what should be considered "passed"
- *An indication of the success of the test* - Need to test everything after each change
Individual tests are usually documented in some sort of tabular form to make it easier to review for correctness and completion

### 4.8 Discuss Traceability of Requirements to Testing
*Traceability Matrix* - helps ensure all requirements have associated acceptance tests, should be developed while the acceptance tests are being written
Each requirement is identified in the matrix, and the acceptance test that will verify that requirement will be indicated

#### Verification
Verification method in a traceability matrix
- Demonstration - verify by operating/using the system (Acceptance tests)
- Analysis - verify through analysis
- Inspection - verify by inspecting the software
