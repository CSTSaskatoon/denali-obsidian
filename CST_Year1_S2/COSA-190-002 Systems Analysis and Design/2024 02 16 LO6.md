# Prepare UML Models for Software Design
#### During the design stage
- Design User interface and present to the customer for approval
- Develop a high level class diagram (analysis Class diagram)
- A detailed class diagram will be create which will detail the exact classes to be created for the software (implementation class diagram)
- Determine how classes will interact with each other to ensure a good software design
- Develop ER diagrams from class diagram
- Develop sequence diagrams
- Develop state transition diagrams
### 6.1 Principles of Graphical User Interface (GUI) Design
#### Usability is defined by 3 components
*Learnability* - Is it easy for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time?
*Efficient* - Once users have learned the design, how quickly can users perform tasks?
*Memorability* - how easily can users re-establish proficiency after not using the software for a period of time?
*Errors* - How many errors do users make and how easily can they recover from the errors? Are the errors severe?
*Satisfaction* - How pleasant is it to use the software?
#### What makes good Design
- *Focus on the users and their tasks* - Design the GUI for the intended users. Understand how they perform their jobs and design a GUI that makes it easier for them to perform their job
- *Consider function before presentation* - It is important to have a good presentation for the GUI but it is more important that it includes all the necessary functionality.
- *Design from the user's point of view* - Use language that users understand (avoid computer jargon) and any processes where users have to perform steps that don’t make sense. 
- *Design to make common results easy to achieve* - Consider how often a function must be performed and also by how many users. Frequently used features should require the least button clicks, features required by more users should be more visible. For each function consider

- *Clear and consistent* - A user has to learn to use a GUI so there should be zero ambiguity (All windows should work the same)
- *Presentation is important* - Consider
	- *Visual order and focus* - Direct user's attention to what's important
	- *Scan ability* - Avoid long paragraphs, break up information
	- *Match the Medium* - If the GUI is to be displayed on a phone it might have different requirements

- *Design for responsiveness* - What a user values most is speed (perceived speed is more important than actual speed)
#### How to design a GUI
Keep in mind it's had to change code once it's written
*Prototype* - preliminary model
##### Two Types of Prototyping
*Low-fidelity prototypes* - Often paper-based and don't allow user interactions (In theory it's easier to create)
- Paper and pencil
- Whiteboard
- Flip chart
- Sticky notes
- Mock-up tools

*High-fidelity* - computer based, allows realistic computer and mouse user interactions
- High-fidelity prototypes let you get as close as possible to the true representation of the user interface
- Assumed to be more efficient at collecting true human performance (Ex. Time to complete a task)
- [*Wizard of Oz techniques*](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-prototype-hi-lo-fidelity/)
	- Wizard is the designer
	- User isn't controlling the page, when they do something the wizard changes the page

Usually you start with low-fidelity test, make changes, and then move to a high-fidelity prototype
#### Ordering of Screen Data and Content
Divide information into units that are logical, meaningful, and sensible.
Organize by the degree interrelationship between data or information
Possible ordering of controls include
-  Conventional (How do others do this)
- Sequence of Use (Order of steps involved)
- Frequency of Use
- Function
- Importance

Form groups that cover all possibilities.
Ensure that information that must be compared is visible at the same time.
Ensure that only information relative to the users’ tasks or needs is presented on the screen.
#### Screen Navigation and Flow
Locate the most important and most frequently used elements at the top left
Maintain a top-to-bottom, left-to-right flow
Assist in navigation by aligning and grouping elements
##### Gestalt Principles of Visual perception
*Proximity* - Items that are near each other appear grouped
- Use boxes and borders to visually group items
- Also applies to labels

*Similarity* - Items that appear similar appear grouped
- If you have a bunch of text boxes that are the same size and are close together they will appear grouped

Sequentially direct attention to items that are
- Critical
- Important
- Secondary
- Peripheral

*Tab order*
#### How to test Designs
*Heuristic Evaluations* - Done by usability expert
*Usability Testing* - Testing with representative users
- Users try to do tasks, observers watch to collect data
- gives data on where users click, etc.

### 6.2 Extracting Classes and Methods from Specifications
Class diagrams are a blueprint of your code
#### Classes from user stories
*Analysis* - Helps you understand the system and what it does
*Implementation* - the design of your program
##### Object-oriented Terminology
In the object oriented view of software, everything is defined around objects
Each object is responsible for it's own data and functions
View of the software data and code is broken down into objects
An object represents an entity (Physical or abstract)
Examples of Objects are - people, buildings, vehicles, windows, trees
How do objects relate to other classes
- Define the object, an object is one instance of that class
- For instance, a blueprint can be used for multiple houses (Blueprint is class, Houses are objects)
- Another Example is a "person" class (can define behaviours, attributes for each "person")
	- Coralee and Jason can be objects of that class (Both instances of *person*)
#### UML Modeling techniques
UML modeling techniques focus on an object oriented approach to software development.
During the analysis phase the initial breakdown of the project into classes is considered. 
At this phase think only of the high level classes and not all the classes that will be required for the complete implementation of the system.
During the designer phase an analysis class diagram will be created that can be used during implementation.
Using an object oriented approach to software development is very important when developing code in an object oriented language like Java or C#.
#### Identifying classes
There are many ways to identify classes from the project documentation created so far.
One method is to highlight all the nouns from the use case diagrams and user scenarios. Once this list is created, analyze to determine which nouns are appropriate for classes
Review the use case diagrams and scenarios for *verbs* - tend to indicate behaviours or functions included in the system
*Adjectives* and *Adverbs* can be used to help identify the attributes of the objects. These attributes describe the state of an object at any point in time and it is likely they might need to be represented as data in the object.
#### Examples of classes for logging into windows
User - username, password
Window - login screen
Domain Controller - list of valid usernames, password pairs, validating passwords
