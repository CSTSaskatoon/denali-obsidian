### 2.4 Explain the importance of client/project team collaboration
The main goal of Agile software development is to help software development teams respond to change
Change is a constant and is expected in software projects
The most important changes a project team deals with are changes to their clients' requirements
There is likely to be change involved in the specifics of certain requirements, as well as to major future functionality
#### Richness of Communication Channel

#### Cold Techniques
Low bandwidth
These techniques
- Typically one way
- Have slower feedback cycles
- Have few parallel communication channels
- Often do not invite or encourage immediate responses or feedback
- Not suited for rapid needs
#### Hot techniques
High bandwidth
Ex. Email. phone/video conversations, face to face meetings
These Techniques
- Fast
- Multipath communication method
- Involve people using many different ways of communicating simultaneously, which often leads to more efficient communication of ideas
- Tend to be less "permanent" than cold techniques
### 2.5 Examine common meeting and reporting procedures
Generally a meeting is held for
1. Exchanging information
2. Brainstorming, option evaluating, and/or Design
3. Decision making
#### Ad Hoc or sidebar meetings
Short, scheduled
#### Client or Stakeholder meetings
Updates on the project, can be Ad Hoc or regularly scheduled, end of each sprint
#### Kickoff meeting
first meeting of the project, includes schedules, status reporting, risks, discussions on legalities
#### Client meeting
exchange information
- Understanding the client's needs
- The client needs to see what the team has produced in order to provide feedback
Outcomes are usually 2 things
- Clarify or develop new requirements
	- Project team must document these requirements
- Action items
	- should have a defined "responsible person" and a deadline to complete the item
	- Needs to be written down to prevent it from being forgotten
#### Client meeting terms
Agenda - outline of items to be discussed. Each item should be listed
Meeting chair/chairperson - Keeps track of the time, on topic
Meeting minutes - Documents action items and other outcomes of the meeting
- Requirements (New or changed)
- Action Items - Items needed to be completed by a specific person by a specific date
Minute Taker - takes the meeting minutes
- All team members should take some minutes, minute taker combines them all into one document
Meeting Minutes Review
- Short and concise - **NOT** an exact play by play, summary is fine
- Cover the highlights - specifically mention each new or updated requirement discovered during the meeting
- Cover the action items - who, when, what
#### Standup Meetings
also called the "Scrum Meeting" or daily huddle
Teams decide on a specific time, and each team member discusses 3 topics
- What I did yesterday? What project related features/stories/research you did during the previous work day
- What I will do today? Could be a continuation of previous work or new work that you will take on
- What is slowing me down? Anything holding up progress

#### Retrospective Meeting
Final stage, discuss what was good and what was bad
Team answers 4 questions
- What went well in the last iteration? Things that the team should do more often
- What did **NOT** go well in the last iteration? Do less often
- What questions does the team have? These can be questions for the client, team members, company as a whole
- What do we need to act on? actions the team needs to take to fix problems they have identified
- Ensures good practices are continued and answers any questions
