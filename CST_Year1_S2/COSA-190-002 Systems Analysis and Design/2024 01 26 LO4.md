### 4.3 Describe User Stories
#### Independent
- Good user stories will attempt to minimize the number of other user stories which must be created first in order to implement some other stories
- Often this means combining server smaller stores to make a bigger independent one
- Can be dealt with through customer priorities
- Having a high priority story dependent on a low priority story can make development difficulty
- Sometimes explaining the dependency to client can help prioritize stories
- Always attempt to minimize story dependencies
- Sometimes stories may seem dependant on another when they aren't
#### Negotiable
- Minimize the number of implementation details, or forced pre-choices when writing the stories
- Stories should provide enough detail to be implemented but not so much detail that you are unable to change or refine requirements
- Details should be determined through future communication
- "Commissionaires will often view a list of vehicles in a parking spot in a ListView ordered by vehicle make" is too specific
#### Valuable (To users and Customers)
- A common mistake in creating user stories is to only create stories which affect the end-users of the software. While these stories are important, the frequent result of this mistake is that non-behavioural requirements, like performance or security, are left unimplemented
- End users and purchasers or owners can have differing requirements
- Another common mistake is to write stories that only the team will care about. These stories will often contain obvious implementation details. For example "The system will use MySQL connection pools" does not provide business value to the customer. It may be a requirement all the same, but on its own does not make a good user story, and would be better suited to acceptance criteria or a team standard
#### Estimable
- Every story must be assigned an estimate of time to be completed
- In order to estimate the story the team needs enough information and background in order to provide accurate data of time to complete
#### Sized appropriately
Stories which are too small will often introduce temporal dependency (separate stories which must be implemented in a specific sequence in order to make it possible to implement)
Stories which are too large will be difficult to reliably estimate
- It's easy to be confident about saying something will take 2-4 hours, but more difficult to estimate with confidence about something that could take several weeks
#### Testable
The story must be written in a way that it's possible to test
Untestable stories are seen when used to test non-functional requirements
When creating stories, always think of how you will test them
- Unit Tests - code that tests the code itself
- Business Level Acceptance Tests
- Formal Acceptance Tests
#### Use Case Scenarios
Also called user scenarios, scenarios, or use cases
Narrative, sequential description of a single occurrence of the user case
Use case Scenarios are used to illustrate alternative paths through functionality of a use case
Use cases are generally very specific - they lay out the exact sequence of events from beginning to end of the user's interaction through the system
Closely intertwined with the UML activity diagram
##### Things to include
Give the scenario a unique ID
Give a short description of the scenario (the goal)
- Ex. successfully logging into the system with valid credentials
give a numbered list of the steps the user takes in scenario, in sequence (actions)
- with these steps, give brief details of the system's response (events)
Use specific people or systems (actors)
##### Things to not include
Multiple failure conditions
Multiple branching paths
- Use multiple scenarios instead. For example, have one scenario for the process of logging in successfully, one for a failed login due to a bad password, one for a failed login due to the AD domain being unavailable, etc.
- Keep scenarios as simple as you can, within reason
##### In short
User scenarios are an expanded form of the use cases described in the UML use-case diagram
Step by step how the Use-case works, what happens when the information is valid/invalid
### 4.4 Identify User Stories and Scenarios
It's common for Agile teams to form User Stories and Scenarios at the same time
