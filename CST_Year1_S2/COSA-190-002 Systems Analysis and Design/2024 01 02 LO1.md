How does software work together?
	Set of instructions (ordered sequence) that tells the computer what to do 
	How a user will interact with the computer hardware
	Consists of binary values which can change the state of the computer
	can be written in machine language, which is the lowest level understandable to specific processors
	Can be written in high-level language (Java) and compiled or interpreted into machine language

Software Complexity
	requires designing the software before actually writing the software code
	Most software requires thought and planning to create efficient, accurate and effective software

Types of software
	Program - Written quickly, specific task in a time and place, often not extensible or well tested
		Design to be run by the author on the system which it was developed
	Programming Product - more generalized form of a program, can be used by a wider variety of users and situations, usually the second generation of a simple program
		Intended to be run, tested, repaired and extended by anybody
		Thoroughly documented and tested to some proven reliability
		Generalized as much as possible to allow greater utility
	Programming System - Collection of individual programs, have specific and well defined inputs and outputs. Each program is documented, tested
		Unix Philosophy - Minimalist software development, reusability and modularity
		Interacting along strictly defined boundaries, with inputs and outputs conforming to precisely defined interfaces
		Extensively tested in any expected combination of functions
	Programming System Project - Combining Programming System and Product

Software Life Cycle Stages
- *PADITIMR*
	Project Initiation
	Analysis
	Design
	Implementation
	Testing
	Installation
	Maintenance
	Retirement

Project Initiation - Establish required functionality, finalizing price and details
	Acceptance of Project Proposal
		Created by customer so they can prove they require a project
		Customer may obtain assistance in completing the proposal
		Proposal should identify the project objective and project scope
		During this, project plan/charter should also be made
	Create a project charter
		Summary of the project
	Create a project plan
		Detailed document on how the project will be completed
		Written by dev team
		It includes objectives, scope, resource estimate, deliverables, risks, standards
	Creating a project team
	Obtaining the equipment or other resources
	Finalizing of contracts with the customer

Analysis (What)
	requirements for the project are detailed and finalized
	The project scope is analyzed to determine each detailed requirement of the system
	This is accomplished by questioning the client, questioning employee who will be using the system, studing the documentation currently in use
	During this stage, the development team will determine what and when data is needed, and it's structure
	Areas that are focused on are business roles, processes and data employed at the customer site
	Business Rules
		determine the logic that defines the process, business dicates how this is done
		Ex. A CST business rule is that a student must get at least a 50% to pass the class
	Processes
		Set of activities are followed to produce output
		Ex. A process may be the act of registering a new student, analysis team walks client through the process, process is documented
	Data
		Facts and figures used within the system
		Persistent vs Temporary
	Requirements Document
	UML Use case Model
		Diagram

	Activity Model
		Don't use for everything

Design (How)
	*IN THIS STAGE A BLUEPRINT FOR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IS DEVELOPED BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SYSTEM*
	Development environment is finalized
	Logical requirements are translated into algorithm or solution strategies
	The Data requirements refined by specifying data type and size
	Persistent storage structure are detailed
	Items created in design stage
		UML Implementation Classification Model
		Revised UML Use Case Model
		Revised UML Activity Model
		UML Sequence Model
		UML State Change Model
		Database Schema

Implementation (DO)
	Development team takes detailed plan and creates code based on the plan, often done at the same time as testing
	Software design is translated into actual software
	Code is written for the first time
	Database queries are created and initial data values are set up
	Software and hardware are configured based on architectural requirements
	Items handled/created in this stage
		Database
		Installation software
		Revised UML Implementation Classification Model
		Code
		Additional files â€“ like scripts, configurations files, etc.

Testing (Verification and Validation)
	System is evaluated for correctness
	Ensuring the system meets requirements and operates in a correct manner
	Items handled in this stage
		White Box test results - Can see code
		Black box test results - Don't have access to the code, focuses on interfaces of the system, often done by the client
	TDD - Test Driven Development (Verification, Combines continuous testing with code generation by setting the tests first and then coding towards passing the tests)
	Validation is obtained via Acceptance Tests (Performed by client)

Installation
	Installation at client side
	Includes the actual placing of software, database, and web content and support software on the client computer.
	During installation, the development team will configure and initialize the database, application software, complete test run, user training
	Items handled at this stage
		Create user and installation manual

Maintenance
	support additional functionality, or fix errors that exist in the system. Typically lasts longer than other stages, accounts for the majority of the cost for most systems
	Providing Support for the system after it has been installed
	The longest and most expensive stage of the cycle
	Includes fixing errors that were not detected earlier in the project
	Additional or modified functionality, may be required to support changing system requirements

Retirement
	System ceases to be used
	Occurs when the system is no longer being used
	The development team shuts down the system, and decommission it
	The final act of the development team is to remove sensitive data from the hardware

### 1.4 Discuss Common Software development Methodologies
	Software Models
	Waterfall
		Traditional way of software development, you always complete one stage before moving on to the next one
		Very linear, not very good because it doesn't leave much room for changes
	Iterative or Incremental
![300](Pasted%20image%2020240105080934.png)
### Agile Software Development
	Focuses on the individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	Working software over comprehensive documentation
	Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
	Responding to change over following a plan
