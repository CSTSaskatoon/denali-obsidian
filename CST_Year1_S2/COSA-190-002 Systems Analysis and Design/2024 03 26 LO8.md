### 8.1 Properties of a good unit test
#### Unit Testing
Type of *White Box Testing* - performed with knowledge of software implementation
A "unit" is small, isolate part of the application
Typically, a unit is on method or at most one individual class
The goal is to isolate that part of the application and verify each small part operates properly

Unit tests are often performed by a test driver - program whose whole purpose is to test other software
Test driver is responsible for exercising the functionality of the code, method by method
Re-running tests to ensure existing functionality still works is referred to as *Regression testing*
*JUnit* is an example of a tool used to perform unit tests
#### Good unit test properties
Generally lead to more modular software
*Isolated* - Outcome of one unit test should not affect another one. Success/failure should not depend on previous tests
*Specific* - Should focus on as few methods as possible, preferably a single method, should cover one requirement
*Small* - fast, easy to read
*Descriptive* - Test should be named in a way that concisely describes the content of the test
*Clear* - Should have clear expectations of the method/unit it is running
*Fast* - Should be as fast as possible to encourage using them more
*Repeatable* - Must be able to reliably run again and again returning the same result unless there is a bug
### 8.2 Differences Between Unit tests and Integration Tests
Unit tests are for single, small units of functionality
Classes it does depend on should be controllable by the Unit Tests themselves

*Integration Tests* cover a comparably large amount of functionality in the application or a larger number of classes/modules
Should check that the smaller tests work together correctly

**The BLAT created as a part of user stories are a form of integration testing as they are often written from the perspective of the user**
While most acceptance tests will be encoded as a series of unit tests, an integration test will ensure the feature works as part of the system as a whole
#### Types of integration tests
##### Big Bang Testing
sometimes as referred to as *Top-Level testing or end-to-end testing*
Most common form of integration testing
Entire system is intended to be assembled and running in an environment that closely resembles production
Generally performed  near the end of software development
Better for detecting high-level errors
##### Bottom-up testing
smallest modules are tested in isolation first
Used for huge projects, not as much for small stuff
### 8.3 Construct a Test Plan
#### Planning Tests
Each functional requirement must have a complete set of unit, acceptance, and integration tests
##### Before you write a test, it's a good idea to write the basic conditions
**PIP**
*Preconditions*
- What objects/configurations are needed for the test can be done

*Input Data*
- Possible values allowed in the system
	- *Normal Case* - Typical functionality of the system
	- *Exception Case* 
	- *Boundary Case* - Values right on the edge of valid/invalid

*Post Conditions and Expected Results*
- What is the system supposed to be like after it's done

| Case      | Preconditions | Input Data | Post Conditions | Expected Result |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Normal    |               | age: 20    |                 | true            |
| boundry   |               | age: 18    |                 | true            |
| boundry   |               | age: 17    |                 | false           |
| exception |               | age: -1    |                 | false           |
| boundry   |               | age: 130   |                 | true            |
| boundry   |               | age: 131   |                 | false           |
| exception |               | age: "bob" |                 | exception       |
#### Examples
##### Method 1
`+int calculateRectangleArea(int height, int width)`
- take in width and height of rectangle and return it's area
- Width and height should be positive
- If the parameters are <= 0, 0 should be returned

| Case      | Preconditions | Input Data                | Post Conditions | Expected Result              |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Normal    |               | height: 2, width: 10      |                 | returns: 20                  |
| Boundary  |               | height: 0, width: 0       |                 | returns: 0                   |
| Exception |               | height: -5, width: 6      |                 | returns: 0                   |
| Exception |               | height: 6, width: -5      |                 | returns: 0                   |
| Boundary  |               | height: 1, width: 1       |                 | returns: 1                   |
| Exception |               | height: 2, width: INT_MAX |                 | Nonsense, usually don't test |
|           |               |                           |                 |                              |
##### Method 2
`+boolean createNewAccount(int accountID, float beginningBalance, String name)`
- Account IDs in the range of 10k-20k
- Must be a database connection to update balance

| Case      | Preconditions          | Input Data                                       | Post Conditions                                       | Expected Result |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Normal    | Database Connection    | accountID: 15000, balance: 500, name: "fuckhead" | Database still connected, new record in database      | returns true    |
| Boundary  | Database Connection    | accountID: 10000, balance: 500, name: "fuckhead" | Database still connected, new record                  | returns true    |
| Boundary  | Database Connection    | accountID: 20000, balance: 500, name: "fuckhead" | Database still connected, new record                  | returns true    |
| Boundary  | Database Connection    | accountID: 9999, balance: 500, name: "fuckhead"  | Database still connected, no new record               | returns false   |
| Boundary  | Database Connection    | accountID: 20001, balance: 500, name: "fuckhead" | Database still connected, no new record               | returns false   |
| Exception | Database not connected | accountID: 15000, balance: 500, name: "fuckhead" | Throw an exception, no new record - *Must decide now* |                 |
*Further test plan items can be added, it would be a good idea to consult the project documentation, existing code in other files, your code standards document, or talk to your team/client for the correct behaviour*
