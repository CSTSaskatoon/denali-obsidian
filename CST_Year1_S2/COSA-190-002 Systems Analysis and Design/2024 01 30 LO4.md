### 4.5 Develop an Activity Diagram
the *activity diagram* is one of the UML diagrams most suited to capturing the flow of a process or activity over time as an actor interacts with the system
An Activity Diagram
- Illustrate the *data flow* of a system and shows the flow of control from activity to activity within the system
- Represents the *decision flows* and parallel behaviour of the processing performed by the system
- Important to develop activity diagrams for any *complicated* processing to be performed by the system
- Help ensure the flow of control and processing is captured correctly
When to use an activity diagram
- Use to model dynamic aspects of the system
- Can be used to model the system as a whole, a subsystem or an operation
- Typically used to model a workflow or operation
- Modeling the workflow will help the development team understand and document the business processes that are involved in the system
- When modeling workflow, the activity diagram focuses on activities as viewed by the actors that interact with the system
- Can also be used to model details of complex computations. When modeling an operation the activity diagram focuses on the parameters of the operation and it's objects
- Will often combine many features or use cases into a single activity diagram
#### Activity Diagrams have 7 major components
*Start point*
- The entry point into the diagram, from which the flow of control originates. Usually, but not always, in response to some user interaction.

*End Point*
- The point at which the process the diagram is representing ends. Every diagram should have an end point.
- Represented by a black outlined circle ![](Pasted%20image%2020240130103547.png)
*Activity*
- Represented by a rounded rectangle with text describing the activity or use case inside ![](Pasted%20image%2020240130103650.png)
*Decision*
- A logical test concerning the results or implications of an activity being performed. Not itself labeled, but the transitions emanating from it are. The preceding activity and the transition labels indicate what the decision was based on.
- Represented by a diamond ![](Pasted%20image%2020240130103819.png)
*Transition*
- A directional line emanating from an activity, decision or other non-transition portion of the diagram, moving towards some other non-transition part.
- Transitions mark the flow of control or operation through the diagram.
- Transitions may be marked by guards, which restrict the conditions under which a transition may be followed.
- Represented by an arrow pointing from the originating object to the receiving object
- Watch out for over-guarding: you can end up stuck inside of an activity ![](Pasted%20image%2020240130104227.png)
*Split*
- Represents a change from linear to parallel activities. If some decision point results in several operations being undertaken simultaneously, then we would use a split to represent those concurrent lines of control.
- Represented by a solid bar into which one transition enters, but multiple transitions leave
- ![](Pasted%20image%2020240130104313.png)
*Join*
- The counterpart of a split. Once all of the activities spawned by a split have completed, a join converges the lines of control into a single exiting transition.
- Represented by a solid bar into which multiple transitions enter, but only a single transition leaves

### 4.6 Acceptance Tests
Testing consists of two basic operations
- *Validation* - Ensure the software performs the functions it was intended to perform
- *Verification* - Ensure that the software is built correctly
Two major categories of software tests
- *Black Box Testing* (Acceptance tests) Black box tests are where the tester has no knowledge of how the software was designed or implemented.  The goal of black box testing is to test the functionality of the system. Black box testing performs validation testing.
- *White Box Testing* (Unit tests) are tests where the tester has knowledge of how the software was designed.  Used to test that there are no errors in the software.  White box testing performs verification testing.
#### Acceptance Tests
- Tests that demonstrate to the customer the system performs all functionality that is required
- Sometimes referred to as functional tests
- Used to test the functionality or sustainability of the system BUT are not connected with how the software is designed or implemented.  Generally written based on the requirements of the system.
- Usually created, early in the software lifecycle
- Ideally created by the client
#### Key points to acceptance tests
*Owned by the customer* - It is ultimately up to the customer as to what they will accept as a functioning system. The acceptance tests are specifying the criteria for the customer to accept the system. These tests must be completed as evidence for the customer to be willing to accept the system as correct and complete.
Typically, the *developer, customer, and tester* and will create the acceptance test procedures together. It is not a good idea to have the developer solely responsible for the development of the test procedures as often the developers tend to test specific technical aspects as opposed to functions of the system. It is very easy for a developer to become blind to simple malfunctions in the system due to their constant interaction with it
*Focus on the "what" and not the how* - The details of how the software was implemented are not important. Acceptance tests are all about what the customer is getting from the system
*Clear and Concise* - Each acceptance test should validate a single aspect of the system. The test should be easy to understand and clearly identify the steps required to perform the test
#### Acceptance Tests in an Agile Environment
acceptance tests for a user story should be determined before the code is written (Test Driven Development)
##### Levels of acceptance tests
Business Level acceptance tests - short sentence on the back of a story card, describing the requirements and restraints
- Sometimes called acceptance criteria
- in an agile environment, clients will help identify what the user story is supposed to do
Acceptance Test Procedures
- detailed, step-by-step description of how to setup, perform and check the result of a test.  The tests need to be detailed enough that someone else can repeat the test
- this is important when you run across a bug and want to be able to verify that the bug is fixed.
### 4.7 Design acceptance tests from Use Case Diagrams and User Stories
*Normal Cases* - (success cases) Typical functioning of the system
*Exception Cases* - Error conditions that may occur. Need to ensure the system is robust enough to handle errors without behaving abnormally
*Boundary Cases* - It is important to test values right at the edge of being valid. Quite a few software errors occur at the boundary of valid/not valid
#### Non-behavioural Requirements
*L* - Also known as stress tests. A test that puts the system under extreme conditions to ensure it can operate in those conditions. Could the system handle all SaskPolyTech campus employees logging in and updating their license places at the same time
*S* - A test that puts the system under an average load for a long period of time. Ex.: Simulate an average of 50-70 employees logging in and performing a standard task, such as viewing or updating their vehicle's license plate. These tests can be helpful in locating errors such as memory leaks or concurrency issues
