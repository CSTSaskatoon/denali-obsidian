### 3.5 Describe methods of identifying risk
Risks - ==are potential factors that may impact the successful completion of the project==
==Primary component of risk is uncertainty==
A risk which is certain to occur is not a risk - it's a fact
*Any event or factor that can affect the outcome of the project* (positive or negative), but for which the likelihood or impact is uncertain can be considered a risk
It's important to identify as many risks as possible so you can deal with all situations
A list of risks is included as part of the project charter
*SWOT* is used for identifying internal and external factors that are both positive and negative to achieving the project's objective
*Strengths*
- Includes skills, assets, information the project team has which makes them more likely to succeed
- Usually positive but it's possible that the team does not have the knowledge of their strengths
- Ex. Team members who have already completed projects similar to the one being analyzed, lack of competitors, client who is highly available and motivated
*Weaknesses*
- Factors that could place the project or team at a disadvantage compared to competitors
- Ex. Competition for skilled project team members within the company, competition issues, team has limited experience using the software systems
*Opportunities*
- Factors outside the project team or company's control
- Gives an advantage to the likelihood of success for the project
- They are outside the control of the team or client
- Uncertainty does exist in whether or not the opportunities will end up being beneficial to the project
- Ex. Favorable economic climate, a strong demand for the type of project the team is creating
*Threats*
- Factors outside of the control of the team or company
- Can damage the likelihood of a successful project
- These are frequently the target of the risk management and control techniques
- Often more difficult to avoid/control than internal risks categorized under weaknesses
- Ex. Competitor completing a similar product more quickly, technical environment rapidly changing, weak economic conditions

### 3.6 Describe Risk Mitigation Planning and Quality Assurance
Mitigation - The action of lessening in severity or intensity
#### Risk Mitigation Plan
Risk Response Plan
indicates how specific risks will be dealt with if they arise
What action steps are required to deal with the risk
Should lessen the impact of the risk on the overall project
Gives team members a strategy and clear sense of the actions they are expected to take
Must continue to be reviewed and managed on a regular basis as the project develops
#### Here are some examples of common project risks
Customer review and feedback cycle
Unexpected budget cuts - Can't implement full functionality at original cost
Unclear roles and responsibilities - time delays, not getting work done
Stakeholder input is not sought, or their needs are not properly understood
Stakeholders changing requirements after the project has started
Stakeholders' adding new requirements after the project has started
#### Risk Mitigation
When working on any project there are 3 main areas of risk mitigation that must be considered
- Identification
- Quantification
- Mitigation
