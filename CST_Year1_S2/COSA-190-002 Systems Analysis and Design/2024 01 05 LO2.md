## 2.1 Explain Projects and ongoing operations
The terms "Project" and "operation" are often used in the same context, but have different meanings
### Defining Process (Baking a cake)
A linear process when given the same inputs will produce the same outputs
The process and it's results are planned in detail ahead of the operation
Doesn't require background knowledgein the area of the activity being perfomed assuming the process is defined well
### Empirical Process (operating an unfamiliar shower)
A process where not all actions and reactions are known ahead of the operation
Progress is made by changing aspects of the process and observing the result. The observations are used to inform future changes
Background knowledge in the area of the activity being performed is required in order to make informed decisions about how to tune the process
### Projects
An empirical process with a known end goal and some known constraints for achieving that goal
The steps needed to achieve that goal are not known in detail
A project will likely consist of multiple interdependent activities which are used to move towards the goal
According to PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge) a project has the following properties
- Temporary - it has an end date
- Goal/Objective oriented - is finished when goal is accomplished/objectives completed
- Can be unique - Where work being conducted hasn't been performed previously
- Integrated - require the work of a group of people with different knowledge
- Emergent - Sometimes work needs to be completed prior to obtaining a clear idea of how to achieve the results
- Social - Projects usually contain multiple project members
- Has an outcome and deliverables - This outcome is usually have some sort of lasting outcome (product/service/result). This outcome can be tangible or intangible
- _A number of activities are undertaken to solve a problem_
### Operations
Considered a defined process. Set of defined steps, known inputs and outputs, repetitive and ongoing
Operation Properties
- Continuous or repetive work
- No end date
- Work follows existing procedures
- Purpose is to sustain the business/maintain operations
- Usually the operations produce the same result

## 2.2 Define Common terms in project management
### Project management
Application of knowledge and skills
#### Managing a project typically includes
Identifying requirements
Addressing various needs, concerns and expectations of stakeholders
Setting up, maintaining, and communications among stakeholders
managing stakeholders towards meeting project requirements and creating deliverables
###### Balancing the competing project constraints, which include
- Scope
- Quality
- Schedule
- Budget
- Resources
- Risks
### Project Management Terms
- Goal - the final desired result, product/service
- Task - a combination of activities that lead to the achievement of a definable result
- Activity - a distinct, scheduled portion of work performed during the course of a project
- Duration - The elapsed time from the beginning to the end of an objective, activity, or task
- Scope - specifies what the project involves. It is the work that will be performed in order to deliver the product/service/result
- Stakeholder - individuals or organizations that are actively involved in the project, or whose interests may be positively or negatively affected as a result of the project execution or completion. They may also exert influence over the project and it's results

## 2.3 Explain Roles and characteristics of a project team
Organizational structure is a factor which can greatly affect a project's availability or resources and influence how projects are lead. Organizational structures can be either functional, projectized or a varying combination of both.
### Functional (Horizontal) Organizational Structure
Each employee involved will have one clear superior
Employees are typically grouped into departments by specialty
Each department works on projects independently of other departments, with limited points of collaboration
### Projectized (Vertical) Organizational Structure
Team members are often co-located for the duration of the project
each team is often focused on a single project
Project Managers have a high level of control and freedom
Employees are grouped into departments, but will work with their respective teams
Departments can either report directly to the manager of the project or provide support services to various projects
### Roles
#### Development Team Members
Development team members are the people who will design, implement, test and deploy
Expected to come with a wide variety of backgrounds
Team members have "T shaped" skills
- Not a jack of all trades, but also not a single skilled specialist
- A broad set of knowledge, but a depth of knowledge in certain areas
- This is reinforced by working on  a cross-functional team
#### Product owner
Someone who acts as a "Client proxy" can help to keep agile teams focused on the customer vision
Product owners help reduce downtime waiting or customer responses
Product owners perform the following
- Act as the voice of the customer
- Responsible for maintaining a cohesive product vision
- Re-prioritizes release and iteration of goals
- Final say on requirements questions
- Decides whether to continue development
- Considers stakeholder interests and weighs them against team reality
- May contribute as a team member, but often acts as product owner for multiple teams
- Leadership role
#### Project Manager
individual assigned by the performing company to oversee that the objectives are being met
### Agile Product Teams
#### Said to have these properties
###### Self organizing
- The team controls their working conditions, organizational structure and way of doing things
- Often referred to as emergent organizational structure. The team decides on the most appropriate way of getting their work done
###### Cross functional
- Agile team consists of members from each level of the software development process
- Agile projects perform traditionally serial development operations in parallel (especially testing)
###### Focused
- Teams which work on either a single or only a very small number of projects tend to be more productive
###### Sustainable
- Agile development puts a great deal of focus on creating working conditions where team members can work at a sustainable pace
###### Long-lived and cohesive
- Agile works best with teams and not groups
- Long-lived collocated smaller teams tend to have more rapid and transparent internal communication, as team members get used to the way other team members think
	- Communication is "hot", high bandwidth

- Having smaller teams helps keep them efficient (Cohn 2009)
	- Less Social loafing
	- Increased constructive interaction
	- Decreased time spent coordinating
	- Small teams are more socially satisfying
	- Overspecialization is less likely
### SCRUM
Feedback loop, Agile software development
NOT waterfall
Divided into Sprints
each sprint has a little bit of each stage in the project
###### Roles
- Product owner - responsible for ROI, final call
- Scrum development team - cross functional, self organizing, collaborative
- Scrum Master - No management authority, facilitator, remove distractions, basically their for moral support
