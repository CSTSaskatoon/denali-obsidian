### Define Scope
*Scope* of a project specifies what the project involves
- what is involved in the project
- what is NOT involved in the project

Important to identify both
#### Out of Scope
recording what isn't in scope is hard
important to note things not part of the project as agreed on by you and the client
#### Recording Scope
Scope can be recorded in the following documents
- Project charter (in the beginning)
- Project plan (more detailed)
- Project Scope statement
- And/or requirements document

Product Scope Description
- A description of the scope of the product being developed

Product Acceptance Criteria
- Description of how the product will shown to be correctly completed when the project is done

Project Deliverables
- A listing of the things that are delivered to the customer as part of the project, as well as any documents that are produced during the project development (status reports, documentation)

Project Exclusions
- Listing of things outside of the project scope

Project constraints
- Things that limit the project team, such as time constraints (when must the project be done by), budget constraints

Project Assumptions
- Things that have been assumed about the project, but will have an impact on the project success if they turnout to be incorrect
- Ex. An assumption may be a new piece of computer equipment will be available at a certain time
### 5.5 Scope Control
*Scope Control* is the process of monitoring the status of the project and product scope and managing changes to the scope baseline
The "scope baseline" are the things agreed upon about the scope
Change is inevitable, scope control ensures all changes go through scope control
- There will be a defined process for how we are going to handle requested changes to the scope
- You need to record all the changes and ensure the customer and performing organization have approved those changes

Changes may include changes to cost/schedule
Advantage of using an iterative approach is the customer can't request huge changes
*Scope Control Creep* - uncontrolled changes which alter 
#### Scope Verification
We need ways of having the customer accept the project as complete (All items within scope need to be accepted)
*Scope Verification* - Process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables
- Includes reviewing deliverables with the client and making sure the client is in agreement that it is adequately completed
- Obtains formal acceptance of deliverables from client

Scope control and scope verification is usually documented in the project plan, or else they are in separate documents that are referred to by the Project Plan (Change Control Process Document, Acceptance Test Plan)
