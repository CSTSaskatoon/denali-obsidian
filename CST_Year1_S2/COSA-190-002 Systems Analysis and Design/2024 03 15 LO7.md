#### Common example of SoC is is the idea of *three-tier architecture*
##### Data Tier
Storing and retrieving data
Provides an abstract interface to data storage/retrieval, making data access form the business logic layer independent of how it's actually stored

Having a well designed interface between the data and business logic layer makes it easier to replace the data-storage mechanism
Interface between business logic and data tiers usually takes the form of *domain objects*, or classes
- Ex. data tier a calender application might accept and produce lists of "Appointment" objects rather than accepting SQL statements
	- less likely to get hacked
##### Summary
Going through each use case then breaking it apart into different activities at each layer can help in developing module software design
### 7.3 "Tell don't ask"
Encourage developers to write their objects tell each other what to do, rather than asking it questions about their state and making decisions/calculations outside of those objects
Objects shouldn't be aware of how other objects do their work
Software in each class has a well defined responsibility will often naturally follow this principle

Related to the concept of *encapsulation* or *information hiding*
- Rather than  providing access to their internal implementation, classes provide a set of actions they can perform, but *hide* how those actions are implemented
- Make decisions which affect an object *inside* of that object rather than outside

If you encapsulate logic that changes something about an object within that object, it gives more security and is easier to understand
*Separate the display methods and the methods that change data*

An equally common sight in poorly designed code is *train-wreck* method chaining, where a method reaches deep into a class hierarchy to retrieve or set some value
- Ex.  A developer working on an ordering system might need to apply a discount to all items of an order with a price over $35
### 7.4 Dependency Inversion Principle
High level modules should not depend on low-level models
- Both should depend on abstractions
- Abstractions should not depend on details, details should depend on abstractions

Most object-oriented software consists of high level more abstract classes which model business logic and the process of the system
- A series of low-level, concrete classes which implement system-specific details
- Essentially, the Dependency Inversion Principle states that a *class should not rely on classes or objects that are more concrete (low-level) than themselves*

In classical software design, software was typically constructed as a set of high-level concepts/requirements which are broken down into smaller and smaller steps
Program flow was modeled as a set of fine steps, each done in sequence
Each step was sensitive to changes
Dependency Inversion intends to reduce overhead of change by distinguishing *what* something does than *how* it does it

It's common to see noobs combine user interface and functionality aspects within the same class or method

### 7.5 Common Design Patterns
Design patterns are sets of class designs and interactions used to solve common problems encountered in software developments
- makes it easier to test/work in a group

Individual activities that take place within the software are often problems that have been encountered and solved
Design patterns are intended to be flexible
- able to support a wide range of programming languages, frameworks and problem areas
#### Design Pattern Categories
*Creational* - Describe common ways in which objects or sets of objects are instantiated and connected together, seek to hide details
- Singleton

*Behavioral* - Describe solutions to common sets of object interactions, seek to create structure about how objects interact with each other
- Iterator
- Repository

*Structural* - help create simpler and more modular inheritance and other relational structures
- Adapter

Before the "Gang of Four" was published, this was the first to describe a set of common behavior patterns and guidelines
##### Singleton
Used to ensure that there will only be one instance of a given object at any given time
- also sometimes used to defer the creation of an object

Very simple to implement in most languages, but you have to make sure *only one at a time* behavior is actually needed
Example
![400](Pasted%20image%2020240315104508.png)
This class implements a logging facility using the singleton pattern
it would be innefficient to create and destroy an instance of logger every time it was needed
- would be simpler to use a class
- Logger has a private constructor which means only methods within logger can create an instance
- Exposes a single static method, `getInstance()`, which will create and save an instance of logger
- future calls will reference this instance
##### Repository
helps devs create more module code when they need to fetch data from a remote source rather than directly instantiating a database
