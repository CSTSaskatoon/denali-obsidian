*Business Level Acceptance Tests*
*Empirical Process* - not everything is known before you begin
*Normal Cases* - (success cases) Typical functioning of the system
*Exception Case* - Error conditions that may occur. Need to ensure the system is robust enough to handle errors without behaving abnormally
*Boundary Case* - It is important to test values right at the edge of being valid. Quite a few software errors occur at the boundary of valid/not valid
*Projects* - have an end date
*Operations* - ongoing, no end date
*Requirement* - what needs to be completed for it to be counted as "done"
*Stakeholders* - people who are invested in the project, either as end users, developers, client, etc.
*Scope* - what is included in the requirement/project
*Goal* - the final desired result, product/service
*Task* - a combination of activities that lead to the achievement of a definable result
*Activity* - a distinct, scheduled portion of work performed during the course of a project
*Duration* - The elapsed time from the beginning to the end of an objective, activity, or task
*Regression Testing*
*Traceability Matrix* - helps ensure all requirements have associated acceptance tests
*Low/High Fidelity Prototypes*
