# Object Oriented Best Practices
Specifications are rarely well-defined
End result of a software product will differ in many ways from the initial intention
Software design must take into account the need to simplify future change
### SOLID
#### Single Responsibility Principle - (SRP)
each class in a system should have one responsibility and one reason to change
#### Open/Closed Principle - (OCP)
Classes should be open for inheritance but closed for modification
#### Liskoy Substitution Principle - (LSP)
Any object in the system can be replaced by it's sub-classes without changes to the code
#### Interface Segregation Principle - (ISP)
No client object should depend on methods it doesn't use
#### Dependency Inversion Principle
High Level (abstract) classes should not depend on low level (concrete) classes
### Software Design pattern
Most software design problems can be grouped into a bucket with other similar issues that have been solved
Common themes/patterns
### 7.1 Single Responsibility Principle
states that each class should have one responsibility/one reason to change
A class which contains many loosely related functions/responsibilities is said to lack cohesion
One way to identify a class with too many responsibilities is to think it would be easy to re-use in another project
- Classes which are easy to re-use generally have few dependencies or other classes which they require in order to function

Examples of things you might need to change in the project
- Internationalization (Canadian Province to USA State)
- Changing database servers
- Password storage location change
- Digital copies of labels (PDF) for email
- connect to Printer via IP
### 7.2 Separation of Concerns Principle
rather than always dealing with individual classes, it deals with *High-Level concepts*
separation of a program into distinct sections/components
Encourages modular design

SoC is implemented by defining set interfaces which describe the behavior of a class/set of classes, and having components depend those interfaces
does not cover Low level details of how those classes are implemented
Hiding methods/information is good so that things stay modular
Having well defined interfaces will lead to more maintainable and easy to modify system
#### Common example of SoC is is the idea of *three-tier architecture*
Method of application design where the application is split into 3 levels
Each segment communicates only with the direct adjacent statement
##### Presentation
*Stupid layer, just displays what it's told by the Business layer*
Commonly considered the "top tier"
- Contains User interface and user interaction

Responsibilities
- Presenting information from logic layers to the user
- Receiving and translating user input to command logic for logic layer
- Informing the user of ongoing operations at lower layers

Generally Specific to the client
- Different implementations of the presentation layer will be created to cater to different clients
- All will use the same set of logic/data layers

*Discord uses different presentation layers for different platforms, but they all use the same Business logic/data tier layers*
##### Business Logic
Often considered the glue of the application, middle tier

Responsibilities
- Processing Commands from the presentation layer
- Applying business rules, logic and validation
- Commands the data to persist or retrieve data
- Communicates with presentation layer to display output
##### Data tier
Mostly handled by libraries these days
