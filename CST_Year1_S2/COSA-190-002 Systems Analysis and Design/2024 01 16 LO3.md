### 3.3 Describe Requirements
A requirement is a statement that identifies a necessary attribute, capability, behaviour, characteristic, or quality of the software
Requirements specify what the software will do, and differences in how it will be implemented for different stakeholders
Requirements are the life of any software project
*They describe the end goal of the project*
#### Functional/Behavioural Requirements
- Describe the *functionality or behaviour that the software must provide*. They must include what activities a certain actor must be able to perform, what business rules must be followed while performing those activities and how end users will interact with the system
- Ex. "Employees must be able to add information about a vehicle to their parking spot" is a functional requirement. Describes some activity that an actor (Employee) must be able to perform using the functional system
#### Non-functional/Non-Behavioural requirements
These requirements *describe the "how" of the system*. They often place constraints in the design or implementation of the system, imposed due to legal, reporting or standard requirements on the business
Examples include
- Technical features
- Availability
- Security
- Performance
- Interoperability
- Reliability
You need to remember to specifically request information from the client about what types of limitations such as those above will be placed on the project
#### Characteristics of a good requirement
- Correct - accurate description of the functionality to be delivered
- Feasible - must be possible to implement
- *Necessary (MoSCoW)* - The requirement must be needed for the system. It will cost more and take longer to develop the system if unnecessary requirements are included
	- Must Have (Critical), Should Have (Important), Could Have (Desirable), Won't Have (Probably won't happen)
- Unambiguous/Concise/Explicit - Can only be interpreted in one way and should relay the exact message
- Verifiable - Must be possible to test/verify that the software meets the requirement
- Complete - Contains enough details to convey what the new system must do under all circumstances
- Consistent - use consistent terminology, preferably domain language. Use a logical and consistent path
### 3.4 Practice Common Methods and Activities for Discovering Requirements
The list of stakeholders created as part of the earlier brainstorming process can be used to create a list of user roles, or actors. Identifying these is an essential part of gathering requirements
Ongoing, iterative process
#### Actor
Some entity which performs an activity using the system created, or interacts with it in some way
Actors are form of domain language
Different actors will use and be affected by the software in different ways
They will have different goals and responsibilities
Each will have to perform different tasks in order to accomplish these goals
*Actors are not always people and can be other software systems, servers, or services*
#### Gathering Requirements
Not every requirement is the same
Different requirements will be discovered using different techniques
often you will discover more details about existing requirements using different techniques
Gathering requirements is an ongoing, *iterative process*
#### Techniques
##### Interviews
Gather a range of actors (User roles) and ask them questions about what their needs for the software include
Try to determine how the users currently solve problems, what information they need and what tools they are currently using
Try to contractual end users, but sometimes proxies (Manager/Supervisor) may be acceptable
It is difficult for users to remember specific details when removed from the context of performing the task
##### Questionnaires
Usually created ahead of time
Often not suitable for discovering new Requirements, but are good for clarifying existing requirements
One-way communication
##### In both cases, questions should be
Open ended - open to exposition and expansion, not simply yes or no questions
Context free - Shouldn't imply that one answer is the correct one
##### Observations/Shadowing
A project team member shadows end users to observer their current way of doing things
Rich communication channel
Can often discover hidden details of how a process actually works
Useful after delivery initial versions of software, feedback gathered quickly
##### Workshops/Brainstorming
Use user interface mockups (No coding, don't make it fancy) on a display and use it to drive the requirements discovery process with end users
It helps if some client/end users feel comfortable when being walked through the process
Build a visual prototype of the software as your users are talking about their workflow
As you prototype, ask
- What will the user do next
- What mistakes might the user make
- What might confuse the user
- What additional information can the user provide, or what would they require

Use models and visuals
Use this as an opportunity to develop domain language model
##### Blitz Planning session
Resembles a standup or brainstorming
project team and stakeholders gather around the table
Each person gets a set of index cards and a marker
Each person writes down a feature, requirement, or a fact about the project, says it aloud and puts the card on the table
15-20 minute timebox
Usually scrum master or product owner will read the cards
