### Software Design Principles
#### Single Responsibility
Classes should only have one reason to change, should implement as few requirements as possible
#### Separation of Concerns
Software should be constructed with separate layers of functionality
Each layers should be concerned with a specific set of tasks
#### Tell, don't ask
Code that uses encapsulation well are generally easier to test
hide what the code is actually doing, don't request information just tell it to do it (*A lot of void methods*)
#### Dependency Inversion
high level classes should not depend on low level classes, but should implement high level descriptions (interfaces) of what those classes will do
### Identify Testable Code Example
#### `calulateRectangleArea`
```java
public int calculateRectangeArea(int width, int height) {
	int area=0;
	if(width>=0 && height >=0) {
		area = width * height;
	}
	return area;
}
```
*The if statement should be changed to `if(width>0 && height>0)`, because it will return 0 anyways*
it is easy to test because
- Single Responsibility
- clear parameters
- No dependencies/other objects
#### `createAccount`
```java
public boolean createNewAccount(int id, double balance, String name) {
	boolean result = false;
	if(this.isValidId(id) && this.isValidBalance(balance) && this.isValidName(name)) {
		DBConnection connection = new DBConnection("username","password","database");
		if(connection.isActive) {
			result = connection.createAccountRecord(id,balance,name);
		}
	}
	return result;
}
```
hard to test because
- Depends on other objects
- Has multiple responsibilities
	- Validates, creates `DBConnection`, saving data

- Good thing is using `isValid` methods which can be tested individually
- Possible way to make this easier to test is to pass in the `DBConnection` as a parameter
	- Allows us to use mocks/fakes in place of the `DBConnection`
#### `AreaOf`
```java
public double areaOf(Circle obCirc) {
double radius = obCirc.diameter/2.0;
double area = Math.PI * (radius * radius);
return area;
}
```
easy to test because
- Single responsibility
- Not dependant on other objects
- easy to understand parameters and return value
- Violates tell, don't ask
- Fix it by moving the `areaOf` method into a Circle class
### Test-Driven development
emphasizes writing unit tests before the code is written
*Extreme Programming (XP)*
sometimes called *Red/Green* unit testing
- tests should fail when first made, then succeed after the code is written
- keeps pair programming devs highly involved
