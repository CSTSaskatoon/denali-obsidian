### 5.6 Requirements Document
*Requirements* are a description of the needs or desires for a product
Each software requirement identifies a necessary attribute, capability, characteristic, or quality of the software
#### Remember, 2 categories of requirements are
*Functional/Behavioural Requirement* - describe the functions/features the software has to provide
- Ex. "The software will store first and last name, address and phone number for each employee"

*Non-Functional/Non-Behavioural Requirement* - Describe constraints on the design or implementation of the software
- May affect the project team's decisions in how they implement the functional requirements of the software
- Ex. "The software will be be written in the Java programming language"
- Ex. "The software will be implemented following the PCI compliance rules and regulations"

project is complete when all the requirements defined are met
The requirements may have changed since the start of the start of the project
#### There are different way of specifying and documenting requirements
*User Story* (Agile) is the primary form of project documentation
- User stories may be written using a variety of different formats
- *Generally include a high level overview of the feature as a title or more detailed description*
- Possibly includes rationale in the body and a set of acceptance criteria which often encode non-functional requirement of the feature

*Requirements document* (Mainly Iterative but sometimes Agile)
- Primary form of the project

*A formal requirements document is specific, explains why the product is needed*
#### Requirements - Primitive Requirements
Before making formal requirements, the team has to make primitive requirements
- often in point form

Start by making a sentence for each requirement in the form
- Attribute to be controlled
- The relation (=,<,>,is, comply with, as defined in)
- Value/Units - number or standard (include units of measurement)

#### Requirements - Formalize Requirements
Characteristics of good requirements
- *Correct* - must accurately describe the functionality
- *Feasible* - must be possible to implement
- *Necessary (MoSCow)* - If the customer doesn't want it, it's not necessary
- *Unambiguous* - The requirement should only be interpreted in one way
- *Verifiable* - Must be possible to verify the requirement is met

Formal Requirements follow a well defined pattern
- Ex. "With respect to \<Feature being described\>, the system \[will/shall/should\] \<The requirement or restriction of feature\>"
##### The following should be considered when writing requirements
Should be written in active voice
- Ex. "The software shall display the rules when T or R is entered on the main prompt"

Keep the short - try to always put one function in each requirement
Use standard terminology when writing requirements
- *Shall* - requirement is mandatory
- *Should* - requirement is desirable (Optional)
- *Will* - statement/fact - nothing needs to be done, things are the way they are
#### Requirements - Categorize
Requirements should be categorized into logical groups
##### Will vary by project, but generally
*By user group*
- Features intended for use by a specific group of actors
- Can be difficult if the same requirements are shared by multiple groups of actors/users

*By feature*
- Grouped around a single feature

*By system*
- group requirements by the major subsystems they directly apply to
#### Requirements -Examples
###### The software shall display the total value of the user's hand when each card is displayed
- Good requirement
###### The user shall enter either lowercase or uppercase letters as input for all commands
- Requirements should be written on behalf of the system, not the user
- "The system shall accept both lowercase and uppercase letters as input"
###### The software shall save the open file to disk after a period of inactivity
- Doesn't specify how long the inactivity is
- Makes the requirement ambiguous and unverifiable
- "The software shall save the open file to disk after 5 minutes of inactivity"
###### The software shall flash the "Traffic" LED with a 1 second period and 50% duty cycle when Ethernet packets are being received
- Good requirement
#### Requirements Document
*Introduction/overview* - Written description describing what the product does
*Specific Requirements* - Separated into groupings which make logical sense
*Appendices* (Only if needed) - Good place to append traceability matrix
*Glossary* - Unusual terms/abbreviations
*References* - List of external references
*Index* - if your document is long

Generally organizations that require Requirements Documents will use a template
Once it's completed, send it to the client
