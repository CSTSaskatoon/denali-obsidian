### 6.3 Develop Analysis and Design Class Diagrams
Once the classes have been identified they can be modeled in a UML Class Diagram
Keep in mind Class Diagrams should be high level view and will be expanded on later
The analysis class diagram is intended to give  a basic idea of entities and high level functionality included in the system
*general roadmap of the problem and what we are going to do to solve it*
#### Analysis Class Diagram
*Represents classes and relationships between classes*
Relationships, or "*associations*" are shown by a line linking two classes
Label the association with a description of how one class interacts with another
Example
- Person and Door
- Person opens the door

Attributes associated with classes are the data for that class
The behaviours are functions performed by that class
A class is responsible for implementing all of it's own behaviours
##### Example
A person can have a name, address, phone number
A person class would have "behaviours" (functions) for walking, talking, combing their hair, etc.
##### Keep in mind
We don't need to be concerned about the behaviours/attributes of the class for the analysis class diagram
Analysis class diagrams are *high-level* (don't get specific with how things function)
#### Analysis Class Implementation
##### Implementation class diagram
Identifies general classes required at a high level
*The diagram will be reworked and expanded during design to identify all required classes and public methods*
##### Creating an Implementation class diagram
determine all functions that will be needed in the code
- Determine actual classes required
- Responsibilities of each class
- How the classes will interact with each other
##### Differences between the Analysis Class Diagram and Implementation class diagram
Methods involved are included in the implementation class diagram
Relationships are defined in the implementation class diagram (*Can't just use normal lines anymore*)
Implementation class diagram is more comprehensive (cause it lists all classes)
#### Association between objects
##### Inheritance
One class is the parent, one is the child
*child class inherits all the attributes and behaviours associated with the parent*
Can also add it's own attributes and behaviours specific to itself
Inheritance is indicated with an open triangle arrow pointing towards the parent
##### Composition
*like aggregation but can't exist without the other class*
Strong form of aggregation
"*Lifeline of the part is bound within the lifeline of the whole*"
Identified by a whole (black) diamond pointing towards the whole
Ex. A House is not complete without a kitchen?
- dogshit example, but basically even if the part is gone then the whole thing is fucked.
##### Aggregation
*Whole-part relationship*
Depicts classes made of smaller classes
One class can still exist without the other, unlike composition
*Identified with a hollow diamond that points towards the whole class*
Consists-of, has-a, is-part-of
Weak form of aggregation
##### Uses (Association)
*Basically a catch all*
"Used for relationships that are not Inheritance, Aggregation or Composition"
Identified by an arrowhead that points from the source to the target object
#### Attributes
Will be stored as data in a class so the type of data storage is indicated in the implementation class diagram
*+* - public, accessible to other classes
*#* - protected, accessible by the class and all child classes
*-* - private, accessible by only it's own class
#### Methods
Implementation diagrams include
- Methods
- Parameter
- Return values
