# Installation Plans
### Migrate data from an existing source to the new system
If the installation is an upgrade or is going to use existing data, ensure the data is transferred to the new system
### Rerun with actual data
May have been done during acceptance tests but if not the system should be tested with actual data
make sure you're getting actual data from your user
### Roll out the system for a few users (pilot)
make the systems available to try out on a trial basis
Can provide feedback
### Provide user training
Present training courses
Deliver user manuals/installation manuals
### Run the new system in parallel
May be a good idea to run the new system alongside the old system for a period of time
Data is entered into the old and new systems
Both old and new systems perform necessary functions
Will prove the new system is functioning correctly
### Switch to the new system
The new system takes over primary function
Old system left in place so it's easy to back out if something happens
### Retire the old system
Back up data from the old system
Turn off the old system once everyone is confident the new system is stable
# Data conversion issues
### Data Conversion
important no data is lost or altered during conversion
### Data conversion plan
Important to design a plan of how the data conversion will happen
Data should always be completely backed up
- Detail the exact format of all the existing data - *could include all tables/fields, datatypes should be documented*
- Detail the exact format of all data that will be stored in the new system
- Determine how all existing data will be stored in that new system - *Detail all fields and tables in the existing system, how they will be mapped to the new one*
- Determine if any conversion of data is required
- Create an automated conversion program
- Validate all data was converted correctly

*Becomes more complicated with live systems that can't experience downtime*
# User Training
### What is user training
Even though the operation of the system may seem logical to a developer, it may not be to the user
Users are sometimes scared of change
There will likely be a productivity loss when moving from one system to another while users are attempting to understand the new system
### Steps for good user training
*Set training goals*
*Assess User Needs*
*Training Delivery*
*Create a training program*
*Make the program flexible*
### Create a Training Package
Has purpose of the system, detailed descriptions of functions of the system, changes from the previous version, common problems they may encounter, security issues
# Software User Manual
### Components
Version or release number of the software product
Overview of the product and basic functionality
High level descriptions of each major  software component
Low level instructions for common use-cases of the software
Contact information where users can request additional assistance
Installation and basic maintenance instructions for the software
### Guidelines
Ensure the user manual has a clear, organized structure, user should be able to quickly navigate it
Create a table of contents and organize content into logical groups (type of user or major functional areas)
Keep your target audience in mind - depending on the size of the manual you might create multiple manuals
Avoid long paragraphs of descriptions of functional or rationale  - use numbered steps
Include visuals
Be consistent with your use of domain language terms/visuals
*Keep a changelog of versions of the manual*
