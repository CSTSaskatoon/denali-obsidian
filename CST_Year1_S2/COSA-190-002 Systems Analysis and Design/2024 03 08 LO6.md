# Sequence Diagrams
Implementation diagram shows you classes that make software but it doesn't show how they work together
#### Definition
- A UML diagram used to describe interactions between objects in the software system
- Clearly shows the sequence (order) of messaging between objects
- Helps developers to understand and visualize the flow of logic between objects within the system
- Extends information from the class diagram by showing interactions between instances of classes (objects)
#### Main reason for making a sequence diagram
- Increased understanding of the system before writing code
- Better understanding of the whole system
- Improving testing and execution

You will take your class diagram and by using the elements you will create the sequence diagram
The models you create will be part of the design phase and should be updated as you make changes
Your sequence diagram should not have any classes, attributes, or methods that don't show up in documentation
- If you are missing these in other documentation, add them
#### Typically create a sequence diagram to model
- Usage scenarios - how the system will be used/interacted with
- Method logic - breaking down complex logic
- Service logic - documentation for services which are intended to be consumed for other systems

Sequence diagrams are probably the most useful diagrams for day-to-day development
- they are closer to the implementation and logic of the system
### Parts of the diagram
#### Targets
parts of the system whose interactions are being modeled
- may be actors or objects (participants in mermaid)

Actors may be represented by a stick figure
Actors will normally be placed on the far left of the diagram
Objects are represented as a rectangular box with normal UML notation for object names
Normally not necessary to create an object with an instance name unless you are going to reference it later or you have multiple
#### Lifelines
indicates the existence of an object or actor
Represented by a dashed line
#### Activations
length of time a method class is active
Indicated as a box on the lifeline
May be multiple at the same time
#### Message
Represents the communication between instances in your sequence diagram
Represented by lines between object lifelines or from an object lifeline to itself
Different types of messages are denoted with different types of arrowheads
The arrow will always point in the direction of the method call (caller to call-ee)
##### Types
Solid line
- Indicates a message is being passed or a method is being called
- includes the name and parameters
- *Solid* arrowhead at the end of the line indicates a *synchronous message*, which means the caller will wait for a reply
- *Open* arrowhead represents *asynchronous*, which means it doesn't wait for a reply

Dashed/Dotted line
- indicates a return value from the message
- Response value can be indicated on the line
- not necessary to include the value if it's obvious
##### Tips
A message and return values can go in either direction which may not be obvious
Messages between objects are composed of the method signature and parameters, possible parameter values and possibly a label for the stereotype
Messages between actors and objects are short phrases describing the interaction (plain text, not code)
Actors can't interact with the system directly, they use an interface
##### Lost and Found
There may be cases where you spread the description of the system across multiple diagrams
can do this by using messages pointing or coming to a single black dot (sending messages to the void)
The arrow pointing towards the black dot means the message is intended for a recipient not shown on the current diagram
- If the arrow is coming from the black dot it means the message is coming from a recipient not shown on the current diagram
##### Self Messages
Objects will sometimes need to send messages to themselves
Can model these with a set of stacked activation boxes
### Frames, alternative options and loops
#### Frames
regions/fragments of the diagram
used to support conditional and looping structures
*Guard Expression* are logical statements (conditions) placed between \[] indicating what needs to be true for the message to be sent
Drawn as a box surrounding messages as part of a condition or loop
- Has a title in the upper left corner describing whether it's a condition or loop
Guard expressions are placed above applicable messages
#### Alternatives
else-if statement
Used for conditionals that have mutually exclusive logic
On a sequence diagram you place a frame and label it *alt*
Place guard expressions above applicable messages
#### Options
Just an if statement, no else
Used for logic when certain messages are only sent when a condition is true
draw the frame and label it *opt*
Place guard expressions above applicable messages
#### Loops
Marked similarly to alternatives and options
a frame marked with *loop* is made to include all messages which occur in the loop
