### 5.1 Describe Methods of Detecting Dependencies between stories
Dependencies exist between user stories or product features when one story or feature appears as though it must be completely implemented and accepted before the implementation of some other story or feature can either be initiated or completed
#### Signs of Dependent Stories
When the same noun or actor is used multiple times, it implies that some specific part of the system must exist before any of the stories can be implemented
The client may describe a set of features in the order they are used to seeing them performed. While occasionally the stories for these features will have to be implemented in this sequence, they can often be combined into larger features, or some workaround can be found
Not all dependencies are based on functionality. External system dependencies are often not found in the language of the client or a story, but based on the team's knowledge of how the story will be implemented
#### Minimizing the impact of dependent stories
##### Separate technical dependent stories from priority dependencies
Functionality described as occurring in a certain sequence by the client may not actually be required to be developed in the same sequence
Other times, seemingly independent stories may be forced into a certain implementation sequence due to technical limitations
These two types of dependencies can be easily described with the create, read, update, delete functionality implemented as the basic behaviour of many systems
###### The team has several options
- Split out a smaller story or subtask which implements the minimum amount of background work required to create the back-end database. Then fill the database with "test" or "dummy" data. Once the smaller set of work is complete, move onto implementing in parallel
- Ask the client why the stories or features must implemented in a specific order. If it's only for the ability to have users present is important, while the ability to add new ones could be done later, the team might import existing data, leaving the dynamic features for later
##### Merge Dependent stories into a larger story
In some cases, the team may find that a group of dependent stories have relatively small time estimates at the end of their estimation activities
Rather than spending more time attempting to decouple those stories from each-other in order to allow them to be completed by different programmers in parallel, they might choose to combine those smaller stories into a single, larger story which simply takes a single programmer pair a slightly longer time to implement
##### Split stories in a different way
Most user stories end up split along "vertical" lines
These stories as worded could introduce some uncertainty around time estimation
Since all of these stories deal with the same set of objects, they are likely to be dependent on each-other, or at least one some piece of shared functionality, such as a database table and related objects used to save the Class data
###### Estimate all setup in a single story
- One story is chosen as the "natural leader" story, to be implemented first and to have the initial setup and programming time included in it's estimate. This allows all other related stories to be estimated independently. (Likely will be the "create class" story)
###### Create internal story
- Instead of only using vertical story slices along functional lines, such as "create" "edit" and "delete" verbs, they could break apart the setup portion of the work into a separate internal story. This story, such as "Access class data in persistent storage" isn't intended to deliver value to the client, but the team instead

### 5.2 Describe Methods of Project Estimation
When the project proposal and initial requirements gathering processes were employed it was necessary to estimate time to complete tasks and the project
It is difficult to estimate accurately but it is very important to try
#### How to make an Estimate
Break down the work into small tasks and estimate them individually
The sum of all the tasks will be the time required to complete the full project
If any tasks are too big to estimate then they should be broken down into subtasks and then each task can be estimated
The smaller the tasks the easier it is to get an accurate estimate
##### There are a number of different methods for performing estimations of project timelines
Estimate the number of methods, then multiply it by the amount of time per method
Estimate the size of the program, evaluate the competency of the development team and plug these values into a pre-made estimating spreadsheet to calculate estimates
Compare to previous projects and estimate the same amount as a previous project of comparable complexity
Ask the company expert
Use planning poker for each task or unit of work (very common in agile)
#### Planning Poker
Steps

Really important that you hear from the outliers because they might think of things you don't
If estimates are really far apart, it's two likely problems
- Product Uncertainty
- Technical Uncertainty
Solutions
- Put the story aside until the uncertainty is resolved
- Use a range as the estimate

### 5.3 Explain the importance of evidence based scheduling
Maintaining accurate statistics on previous projects is beneficial when estimating new projects
It is also important to maintain project statistics for determining if the estimated completion date is correct
As a project proceeds you will be able to estimate a more and more accurate completion date

At proposal or project initiation time there is much uncertainty in the project
This makes it difficult to make accurate estimates
As the project progresses the amount of uncertainty is reduced
This amount of uncertainty is indicated by the open side of the triangle
As we continue throughout the project, the amount of uncertainty is reduced as indicated by the narrowing of the open end of the triangle
As the project progresses, better and better estimates of remaining work to be done can be made
At the end of the project the exact costs are known and this information should be used in estimating future projects
*In summary, you don't have a great estimate at the beginning of a project but it gets better the longer you are in the project development*
#### Time Tracking
Time tracking is an important tool in helping make better estimates, on a current project and on a future project
Benefits
- It lets you know how much time has been spent so far on the project
- Information can be used to more accurately estimate remaining time to complete the project
- Information can be used on future projects for making better estimates
#### Tracking percentage Complete
When working on a project it's useful to know how much of the project is complete
#### Graphical Representation of progress
Chart how much time you expect it take, and record your progress in regular intervals

### Define Scope
"scope" of a project involves two things
- what
- what
Important to identify both
#### Out of Scope
recording what isn't in scope is hard
important to note things not part of the project as agreed on by you and the client
