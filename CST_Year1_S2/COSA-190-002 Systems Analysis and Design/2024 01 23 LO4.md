### 4.1 Practice Use Case Diagrams
Note the different parts of this use case diagram. It contains one Actor (Employee), and 5 use cases and associations. One use case is noted as being outside of the boundary of the system - while it is an activity a user may want to perform, it will be performed by some other system.

#### Actor Types
Primary - an actor that is trying to perform the desired functionality
Secondary - an actor our system uses to perform that functionality
Often, primary actors are shown on the left and and secondary actors are on the right
Not every system has secondary actors
#### Relationships Between Use Cases
Use cases can have relationships with other use cases
3 possible use case relationships
- *Include* - relationship where one use case includes the functionality of another use case as a part of itself
	- Indicated by a dashed line with an open ended arrow pointing at the "part" which is included in the "whole", annotated with "includes"
	- Ex. to complete the "make a cake" function, the "Bake in oven" and "Mix cake ingredients" functions must also be completed.
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020240123101844.png)
- *Extends* - relationship where one use case takes functionality and characteristics of another use case and adds/changes it
	- ○ Often used to note that functionality is intended to be re-used in slightly different ways by different actors, or to add additional steps to an existing use case
	- ○ Indicated by a dashed line with an open-ended arrow pointing from the "child" (extending) use case to its parent (extended) use case
	- Ex. "Employee purchase item" includes all of the functionality of "Purchase item", but adds extra behaviour (such as applying a discount) to that base behaviour
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020240123102215.png)
- *Generalization* - this association exists between use cases when one use case is a specialized version of another use case
	- Similar to extends but in a generalization association any child use case can replace the parent use case without affecting the business flow, but with extends the child use case is adding functionality on top of the parent's functionality and therefore depends on the parent's existence
	- Noted with a solid line with a hollow boxed arrow pointing from the child to the parent
	- Ex. "Pay for item" describes the basic functionality, which could be implemented in many ways. One of these ways is "Pay with credit card", shown here, but others like "Pay with cash" could exist

### 4.3 Developing Use Case Diagram
Ask the client a list of questions
The whole purpose is to gain a better understanding of the system and the client's requirements NOT just a diagram
#### Actor Identification
*An actor is anything or anyone that will interact with the system*
Actors are always external to the system
- Varieties of different people using the system
- Another software program that performs actions on the system
- A piece of equipment
To identify actors look at project info (project plan and proposal)
- Who operates the system?
- Who shuts the system down?
- Who maintains the system?
- Are there external software systems that must be connected?
- Is there any equipment that the system must interface with?
- Who/what will supply/use/remove data to/from the system
Another method for identifying actors is to look for nouns in any of the system description/documentation
**Your external actors must interact with your system**
#### Use case identification
Functions that the system must perform
To know what the actor needs from the system, ask
- What are the goals that an actor expects the system to accomplish
- What information will an actor provide to the system
- Will an actor require data to be stored, changed or deleted
- Will an actor initiate functions on the system (startup/shutdown)
- what changes in the system do actors need to be notified of
Another method for identifying use cases is to look for verbs in the system description
Sometimes these verbs represent classes
### 4.3 Describe User Stories
#### The card
Physical index card to keep track of story information
Focus on open communication with the client and their changing needs
![](Pasted%20image%2020240123112837.png)
*Title*
- Describe requirements expressed using active language
- Include an actor, a brief description of the feature
- Free of specific details which tie the team to a specific implementation
Active language means story titles don't include "can" or "may"
*Description*
- Short description of the requirement
- Describe the who, what and (optionally) the why
- A common format is "As *user role*, I want to *action*, so that I can *reasoning*"
*Estimate*
- How much time the team thinks the story will take to complete
- use in person hours
*Priority*
- How important the story is to the client
- Unit varies, use either a priority number or a more general high-low rating
#### The conversation
Often described as "promise of future communication"
Forces the team to rely on ongoing communication with the client
#### Confirmation
Frequently called
- Acceptance criteria
- Definition of "done"
- conditions of satisfaction
- business level acceptance tests
include details of the conditions under which our client will consider the feature described by the story to be "complete"
These acceptance tests can be used by a product owner or the product team during a demo of the story to see whether or not it should be considered "done"
May also include implementation details commonly includes non-functional requirements such as security or performance implications
#### INVEST
