Systems projects are initiated by various sources for many reasons. Business people typically suggest Systems Projects for 2 reasons
- They experience problems that lend themselves to Systems solutions
- They recognize opportunities for improvement through upgrading, altering or installing new systems
### 3.1 Explain Methods of Problem Identification
Software projects are always intended to solve some business problem. They will address some need or want of their intended users
The initial vision of the project is not often how the project turns out in the end
#### Agile Modeling
*Usage Model* - explore how users will work with the systems and what each category of users' want/needs from the system (*not a complete picture*)
- Team/client brainstorming
- Client questionnaires
- Job shadowing
*Domain Model* - figure out how the client likes to talk and work with things, and explain things to them in that way instead of your own terms
- The set of terminology client's use is often called *domain language*. Creating a dictionary for the domain language can be helpful in creating more meaningful dialog with the client
*User Interface Model* - clients will have an initial vision for what their project will entail, ideas about workflow, and how the software will appear (*interface*), sketching initial visions and talking about them with your client/stakeholders can be helpful in the initial scope and planning stages. Working through a rough interface model (*low-fidelity prototype*) can be useful in guiding further requirement gathering
### 3.2 Identify Stakeholders, their interests, involvement and impact on a project
Stakeholders are those people or organizations who will be affected by the project
- *Interest* - End users, customers, or anyone else who may receive some benefit from the outcome of the project
- *Involvement* - developers, managers, client contacts, support staff, anyone who will be directly or indirectly involved in the process of constructing the project
- *Impact* -  managers, clients, competitors, anyone whose decisions could change the direction or scope of the project
Different stakeholders may be more interested in one part of the project than another
- *Outputs* - Stakeholders that are more interested in the outcome of the project (Ex. End Users)
- *Inputs* - Stakeholders that are interested in the inputs (Ex. Sponsor that is only willing to invest so much money)
- *Process* - Stakeholders that are most interested in the project processes (Ex. Project team members)
It's important that you get the right people in contact
#### Brainstorming
- Provide a basic overview of the problem needed to be solved
- Allow a variety of people to comment or combine ideas as this is how the greatest benefits often result
- Allow people the opportunity to do some pre-thinking on the problem
- If the brainstorming group is not familiar with each other you may want to do some ice breaking exercises to create a safe sharing atmosphere
- All ideas are to be written down using whatever tools you have available (Post-its, whiteboard, scrap paper)
- Express ideas in the participant's own words (Don't change their idea to your own viewpoint)
- Do not allow criticism of anyone's ideas. this will cause the group members to be less inclined to participate further
- Do not permit one person or group of individuals to dominate the brainstorming sessions. Goal is to hear from everybody
Important that requirements from stakeholders don't conflict with one another.
Look for areas of commonality
# 3.2 Exercise
### Stakeholders
Students - Get the certificate (*interest*) ==Client==
Instructors - Experience, teaching (*Involvement*)
Developers - The process, technical stuff (*Involvement*)
Health Promotion Coordinators - Want more people to know how to use respiratory devices, Program head, program planning and organizational tasks (*impact*)
Committee of experts who review the course contents - ensuring course meets medical standards (*Inputs, process*)
CEO - tax evasion (*Output*)
