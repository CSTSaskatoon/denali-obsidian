# Forms
### What is a form
A form is basically an interface where users input, view, or modify records in the database, whether to single or multiple tables, using tables or queries
A form can also be used to move around in an application
View all available forms by using the Form button from the navigation pane window
### Types of Forms
Splash Screen - first screen a user sees when starting the database application
- Can be used to promote a company, service, or product
- Can inform the user of the software needed to run the application
Switchboard - contains command buttons or other controls for opening parts of the database, usually other forms and reports
- Usually displayed when the database is opened
Single Table - A form bound to a single table or query
- Used to display or present the data to the person accessing the database
Form/Subform - A combination of two forms, usually based on two tables in a one-to-many relationship
- the main form shows the data from the table on the "one" side of the relationship (master table) 
- The subform shows the data from the "many" side of the relationship (details table)
- Ex. Customer (master) and Customer Orders (detail)
AutoLookup Query - Like a form/subform, main form depends on a query that automatically fills in certain field values for a new record; the subform object is usually a table

### Form Layout and Design
When designing a form, one must consider the needs of the user. Consider using an existing paper form as a starting point for your design
*The form should be uncluttered and consistent*
#### Layout Design Criteria
*Logical Grouping of controls*
- Group controls in the sequence they would be entered into a physical form
- Ex. See Customer form above
- Groups the contact's name, work address, and phone numbers together
*Alignment of controls*
- Aims for consistent alignment to make the form more intuitive and easier to read
- Ex. See customer form above
- Labels are aligned on the right, text fields aligned on the left, label/text pair aligned on the top
*Choice of colors*
- Colors should be easy to tolerate since forms are used repetitively for data entry
- Avoid overly bright colors, vivid colors, pale colors or too many colors
- Avoid low contrast color combinations
- Avoid red and green colors together
*Use of whitespace, balance of controls*
- whitespace is the empty space between controls
- Achieve a balance based on the placement of controls on the form
*Tab order*
- This is the order followed when the user presses tab to move from one field to the next
- The order should emulate the order the user would follow to enter information naturally
#### Naming conventions

### Properties of Form elements
Each object on a form has a set of properties that control the attributes of the object (formatting, data, events)
#### Form Properties

If the property window is not showing, right click on the button and choose properties, left double click the form objects button or press F4
#### Object Properties
To find out more about a particular property, click in the property's field and press F1 to view help
### Creating a form from scratch
The three examples of methods to create a form were able to create a form quickly, but the designer had little control over where the controls were placed
Blank form button brings up a new form in layout view, Form design button brings up a new form in design view
Using either, the designer can build a form from scratch
The designer must do more work, but they have the most control and flexibility
#### layout view vs design view
Layout view
- More visually oriented
- Controls show real data
- Good for setting the size of controls or other settings related to the visual appearance
Design View
- More detailed view of the structure of the form
- All 3 header, detail and footer sections are available
- Do not see real data
- Able to add more controls (labels, images, lines, etc.)
- Able to resize sections (header, details, footer)
- Able to change certain form properties not available through layout view
### Creating a form in Design View
Click "add existing fields" button in the design tab, Tools group
Or click ALT + F8
#### Review Tools available in the form design tools
Includes Design Tab, Arrange Tab, Format Tab
