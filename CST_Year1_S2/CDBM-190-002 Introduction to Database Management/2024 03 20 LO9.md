### 9.3 Datatypes
#### Variables
declare a variable with `Dim`
`Dim variableName As dataType`
##### Variable names
must being with a letter but afterwards can contain letters, underscores, and digits
Up to 255 characters
Must be unique within the event, procedure, function or module
Can't contain spaces or other punctuation except for underscores
Can't be a  `VBA` keyword (*reserved words*)
When you declare a variable, it has a default value
- 0 for numeric data
- "" (empty string) for string variables

#### Explicit Variable Declaration
*Implicit typing* - VBA changes any undeclared variable type to *Variant*. Generally something to avoid
*Explicitly declared* - program declares a datatype for a variable prior to use

To enforce explicit declaration, you can add `Option Explicit` to the top of the document
- works like "use strict" in JS
#### Constants/User-defined datatypes
*Constant* - a value in memory that doesn't change
`Const sngGST = 0.05`
to create a global constant, use the *Public* keyword
`Public Const gsngGST = 0.05`
#### System defined constraints
Constants defined by the VBA library
- True
- False
- Null
#### User-defined datatypes

*Won't really use*
### Arrays
Variable that stores a collection of values, called elements of a single type
VBA arrays are zero-indexed by default
Declare an array
- `Dim astrName(19) As String`

Multidimensional Array
- `Dim alngName(9,9,9) As Long`
- can have up to 60 dimensions
### Intrinsic constants and Enumeration
*Intrinsic Constant* - built-in constants that in practice are used to affect built-in function behaviour such as telling the function to open a report in print preview
### Bang and Dot
late Bound - The method being called is looked up at runtime (not compile time)
Bang(!)
- Late bound (checked at runtime)
- Command completion doesn't work cause it's checked at runtime
- Traditionally used to index into the collection for a specific member
- Collection can be things like Forms, Tables, Controls

Dot(.)
- Early bound (checked at compile time)
- Does have command completion
- Traditionally used to indicate that what follows is a property or method of the preceding object
- Can pretty much use for anything nowadays

*Can pretty much use . all the time*

The *Me* self-reference
- used to access the current form inside of that form's module
- like `this` keyword from JS/java
#### Example
Assign "your name" to the value of `txtCustomerName` text box
1. Specify the collection (forms)
2. Specify the specific form (`frmCustomer`)
3. Specify the textbox name (`txtCustomerName`)
4. Specify the value property

*Don't include spaces in your variable names*
- if you do, put square brackets around the stuff with spaces

```vba
Forms.frmQuickExample.txtID.SetFocus
param = Forms.frmQuickExample.txtID.Text
```
*For many properties to work, the control must have focus*
Value property doesn't need focus to work
