# 4.4 Differentiate Between Inner Joins, outer Joins and self joins
JOINs allow us to query data in a number of ways. They can combine rows from two or more tables by using values common to each
### Inner Join - Default

- Only records where values in the connecting field are equal will be included in the result set
- Most common form of join
- Default join type
- Based on the relationship between a field in the parent table and a similar field in the child table
- If a record in the parent tables does not have a matching record in the child table, the parent record will not be included in the result set
### Outer Join
Outer Joins are divided into right and left joins
In both cases, fields without a match will display a null value

#### Left outer join

- display all the records in the table on the left side of the join and only records from the table on the right side of the join where there is a record
- Typically, the parent is on the left

*If you need to find all employees with no orders, you can do a left join and then only display employees with no orders by putting Is Null in the criteria for the other column*
#### Right Outer Join

display all the records in the table on the right side of the join and only records from the table on the left side of the join where there is a record
#### Self-Join
Joining a table to itself
Useful for if you have supervisors in the same table as other employees
This type of relationship must exist to physically implement a role relationship
To create a self join, the same table must appear more than once in the FROM clause, and at least one of the tables must be given an alias
This is necessary to distinguish between the two tables

Open the properties table for one of the tables, and change the name
