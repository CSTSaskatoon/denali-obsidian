# Review Learning Steps
- Explain the term query as it relates to relational databases
- Discuss Structured Query Language (SQL) advantages
- Use the Query By Example (QBE) window to create simple select queries
- Sort data result sets
- Using SQL, identify the parts of a SELECT query
- Use query comparison operators
- Use query logical operators
- Use SQL operators
### Queries
What is a Query?
Queries are used to
- Display selected information from tables (limit the fields displayed)
- Sort records
- Perform calculations
- Generate data for forms, reports, and other queries
- Display information using different joins
- Add, update, and delete records from tables
#### Types of queries
*Select Queries* - selects records from one or more tables (usually based on criteria)
*Action Queries* - queries that actually do things
- make table query
- Append query - append records to existing table
- Delete query - remove records from tables based on criteria (or don't have criteria, your choice)
- Update query
*Crosstab Query* - summary query with columns, rows and values at the intersection of the columns and rows (like a pivot table in excel)
*Parameter Query* - enables the user to input the criteria
*Other select Queries*
- Total queries - avg, min, max, sum, count
- Find duplicates query - make sure you have your primary key set properly
- Find unmatched data
- Top value queries
#### Record set (or result set)
Results from running a query
The query structure is saved, but the record set is not
The record set is generated every time you run the query (*Makes it dynamic*)
Enables tracking changes to the data
#### Advantages of SQL (Structured Query Language)
Allows users to access the data in a database
Is standardized
Used to create, maintain and query the relationship database
Uses regular English words
#### 9 Steps to create a new Query
1. Open DB
2. Open the query window in design view (*Query By Example (QBE) grid*)
3. Identify fields to include in the query
4. Identify the tables that contain the fields (**If the tables are not adjacent, you NEED a connecting table (Ex. OrderDetails connects Product and Order)**)
5. Choose the type of query (default is select)
6. Define the criteria
7. Define the sort order
8. Run the query
9. Save and close the query
Make sure you test incrementally
### Parts of a SQL Query
view the queries in SQL view and notice which of the following parts are present in the query
*SELECT* - field list
*FROM* - table list
*WHERE* - criteria
*ORDER BY* - sort list

### SQL Operators
Like

BETWEEN
- Defiles a range/inclusive
IN
- Defines a list/set - IN("SK","AB","MB")
IS
- used with NULL, IS NULL or IS NOT NULL
- Only way to check for a null in a field
- *NULL is undefined* - not a space, not 0
