### 7.1 Associate a query with an unbound combo box or list box control
many controls are bound to specific fields in a table or query. When the user changes the data in a bound control, the data in the underlying table is also changed
#### Steps to associate a query with an unbound combo box control
A combo box or list can be associated with a query so the values available will be automatically updated if new values are entered in the underlying tables
1. Create a query
	- Open a database (We use Northwinds_Revised_Forms)
	- Create a new query based on the Category table
	- Select the CategoryID, and CategoryName fields
	- Save the query as "qryCategory"
	- Sort by CategoryName ascending

1. Create a new form in form design
	- Turn off the "Use Control Wizards" (Under Form Design Tab - Controls group - Drop down arrow)
	- Add a combo box to the form
	- View the properties for the combo box
	- In the data tab of the properties, change Row Source to qryCategory (created above)
	- Make sure the Bound column is set as 1 (CategoryID column) from the query
	- In the format tab of the properties
		- Change the column count to 2
		- Adjust the column widths to "0cm;1cm" - *This will hide the primary key value and only show the category names*

	- Change the combo box's name to cboCategory
	- Select the combo box's label
	- Change the combo box's label name to lblCategory
	- Change the combo box's label caption to Category
	- View the form (do this as necessary throughout this process to best effect)
	- save the form as *frmUnboundComboBox*
#### Steps to associate a user to select a choice from a list of possible values. The user usually does not have the ability to add values
1. Create a new form with a list box associated with the qryCategory to the same standards as above
2. Save the new form as frmUnboundListBox

Specialized control properties
- Limit To List (Combo Box only) - Limits a combo box's values to only the listed items (Can't enter your own stuff)
- Allow Value List Edits (Both) - Gets or sets whether the *Edit List Items command* is available when the user right-clicks a list box
- List Items Edit Form (Both) - Gets or sets 
### 7.2 Create an autolookup query
