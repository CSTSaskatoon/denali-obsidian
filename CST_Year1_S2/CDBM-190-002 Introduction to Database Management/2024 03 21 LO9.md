# Notes
## 9.4 Scope and variation of variables
### Variable scope
*Scope* - Portion of code that can access a variable
Dependant on where a variable is declared
#### Four levels of scope
*Local*
*Form/Report level*
*Module level (similar to form/report level)*
*Global/Public*
#### Duration of variables
*Duration* - A variable characteristic which refers to how a variable exists
*Dim* - Exists only during the duration of event/procedure
*Static* - Used if you have multiple runs of the same procedure, exists over the lifetime of the application
## 9.7 Create a form process using database objects
### Form Event Procedures
*Event Procedure* - Procedure that runs in response to an event initiated by the user or program code, or triggered by the system
*Form Event* - An action that is associated with a control in a form (Usually because of user actions)
#### Examples
Mouse clicks or movements
Changes to data
Opening/closing forms, other activities
### Properties - Text vs Value
*Text* - For setting/returning the text contained in a textbox (Actually the current text visible in the text box) *Needs focus*
*Value* - sets or returns a control's default property - more or less maps text in a text box *Actually returns the "saved" text from the text box*
- For other controls, maps to various other properties
## 9.8 Create user-defined functions/procedures
### Procedures
Basically void functions
Syntax
- can use `Public`, `Private` or `Static` prefix
- `Static` preserves
### Functions
Procedures that return something (Not void)

# VBA Code
## 9.7
### Get Movie/Clear text buttons
```VBA
Private Sub cmdClear_Click()
    Me.txtActor.Value = ""
    Me.txtMovie.Value = "" ' Either null or "" works
End Sub

Private Sub cmdMovie_Click()
    Me.txtActor.Value = "Julie Garland"
    Me.txtMovie.Value = "A star is born"
End Sub
```
### Exercise 9.7
#### Question 1
```vba
Private Sub cmClear_Click()
    Me.txtMessage.Value = ""
End Sub

Private Sub cmdEnterText_Click()
    Me.txtMessage.Value = "FUCK"
End Sub
```
#### Question 2
```vba
Private Sub cmClear_Click()
    Me.txtMessage.Value = ""
End Sub

Private Sub cmdEnterText_Click()
    Me.txtMessage.Value = "FUCK"
End Sub
```
#### Question 3
##### Colors
```vba
Private Sub cmdBlack_Click()
    Me.txtBottom.SetFocus
    Me.cmdBlue.Visible = True
    Me.cmdBlack.Visible = False
    Me.txtTop.ForeColor = vbBlack
    Me.txtBottom.ForeColor = vbBlack
End Sub

Private Sub cmdBlue_Click()
    Me.txtBottom.SetFocus
    Me.cmdBlack.Visible = True
    Me.cmdBlue.Visible = False
    Me.txtTop.ForeColor = vbBlue
    Me.txtBottom.ForeColor = vbBlue
End Sub
```
##### Enable/Disable Buttons
```vba
Private Sub cmdDisable_Click()
    Me.txtBottom.SetFocus
    Me.cmdEnable.Visible = True
    Me.cmdDisable.Visible = False
    Me.txtTop.Enabled = False
End Sub

Private Sub cmdEnable_Click()
    Me.txtBottom.SetFocus
    Me.cmdDisable.Visible = True
    Me.cmdEnable.Visible = False
    Me.txtTop.Enabled = True
End Sub
```
##### Right/Left buttons
```vba
Private Sub cmdLeft_Click()
    Me.txtBottom.SetFocus
    Me.cmdRight.Visible = True
    Me.cmdLeft.Visible = False
    Me.txtTop.TextAlign = 1
    Me.txtBottom.TextAlign = 1
End Sub

Private Sub cmdRight_Click()
    Me.txtBottom.SetFocus
    Me.cmdLeft.Visible = True
    Me.cmdRight.Visible = False
    Me.txtTop.TextAlign = 3
    Me.txtBottom.TextAlign = 3
End Sub
```
##### Load
```vba
Private Sub Form_Load()
    Me.txtBottom.SetFocus
    Me.cmdBlack.Visible = False
    Me.cmdLeft.Visible = False
    Me.cmdEnable.Visible = False
End Sub
```
### ChangeCase example
```VBA
Private Sub cmdChangeCase_Click()
    Me.txtNewCase = ToggleCase(Me.txtCase1.Value) & " " & ToggleCase(Me.txtCase2.Value)
End Sub
```

```vba
Public Function ToggleCase(strToChange As String) As String
    ' change the firs letter to lowecase and remainder to uppercase
    Dim strTemp As String
    strTemp = LCase(Left(strToChange, 1)) ' convert to lowecase
    strTemp = strTemp & UCase(Right(strToChange, Len(strToChange) - 1)) 'append and uppercase
    ToggleCase = strTemp
    
End Function
```
