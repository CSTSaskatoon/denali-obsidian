# NOTES
### 1.1 Describe the Function of a Database
---
What is a Database?
	An organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system
	Usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS)
	Together, the data and the DBMS along with the application associated with them are reffered to as the database system (Oracle website)
Database Management System (DBMS) is a software program that
	Store information in a defined structure
	Allows the user to create, edit and update a database, and then retrieve and analyze the data
	Manage and control access to the database
	Translates the user's data requests and extracts information on that basis
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
	Allows you to perform the same tasks, but gives the added flexibility of organizing the data into a collection of tables
	The relationships exists between the tables in RDBMS are formed by linking common fields
	Access is a RDBMS
Database vs Spreadsheet
	Amount of data being stored is large
	Analysis of the data can be more complicated
	Information is subject to many changes
	Records are maintained for ongoing use
	You require detailed reports
	Multiple user access
Spreadsheet
	Crunching numbers and automatic calculations
	Performing financial and numerical analysis
	Track simple lists by sheet (typically)
	Easily chart your data
	What-if analysis
### 1.2 Identify Components of a Database
---
A database is made out of tables
	Table - A storage container that holds a collection of related data about a specific topic (entity) Ex. student record (Info like name, address, phone number, etc.) The data of a table is organized into records
	Record/Row - Makes up the table, stores related information about the specific item. In Access, each instance is row in a table called a record
	Fields/Columns/Attributes - A record is broken into fields. A field is the smallest element of the database. Each field stores a specific piece of information such as name, address, phone, city, etc.
Access Objects
	Forms - created so that end-users can interact with the database (entering, viewing, or editing data)
	Queries - a method for viewing specific information or performing calculations on data (Not as in depth as Excel) often based on specific criteria
	Reports - formatted output based on queries
	Macros - a stored set of Access macro commands that can be repeated as a unit to automate database functions (limitation - no data access, looping, or branching)
	Modules - VBA code - programming language built into access (performs all tasks that macros cannot)
### 1.3 Perform program startup and shutdown
---
Use online content as a reference
Open an existing database
### 1.4 Describe the Access interface

Compacting and repair database
