### 7.2 Create an Autolookup Query
Reduces the amount of data a user has to enter into the form
#### Create a query for tables in a one to many relationship
When a user selects a value to appear on the many side, the corresponding fields from the one-side will be filled in
1. Create the query
	- New Query
	- Customer and order table (One customer places many orders)
	- Add all fields including `CustomerID` from the Order table
	- Add all fields except `CustomerID` from the customer table
	- Save the query as `qryCustomerOrders`

2. Create the form
	- New form in Design View
	- Set form property to use `qryCustomerOrders`
	- Add fields from the query
	- change the text boxes to combo boxes for `Customer`, `Employee` and `ShipVia`
		- right-click, change to, combo box
		- Adjust properties of the combo boxes to use query, bound column, column count, and column width
			- `SELECT DISTINCT [Customer].[CustomerID], [Customer].[CompanyName] FROM [Customer] ORDER BY [CompanyName];`
			- `SELECT DISTINCT Employee.EmployeeID, [LastName] & ", " & [FirstName] AS EmpName FROM Employee ORDER BY  [LastName] & ", " & [FirstName];`
	- Ensure bound column is set to 1, column count is 2, and the column widths is set to 0cm;2.54cm;
### 7.3 Create a combo box or list box based on a value
useful if you don't want it to be dependant on a table
#### Making a combo box
1. Edit `frmUnboundComboBox`
2. Add Combo Box
3. Properties
	- Row source Type - Value List
	- Row Source - enter semicolon separated list or use `...` to bring up dialog box
		- days of the week
		
	- Limit to list
		- yes - means only these values entered
		- no - means other values can be entered
		
	- Allow Value List Edits
		- No - No dialog is presented to add items to list
#### Making a List Box
1. Edit the `frmUnboundListBox`
2. Add a list box
3. Set properties
### 7.4 Design Forms Requiring Subforms
In many situations, the data to be entered or viewed depends on two or more related tables in a one-to-many relationship (master/detail). Where such a relationship exists, one method to present the information is to use a form/subform.

Examples
- Orders placed with a supplier - one supplier has many orders placed with it
	- Show the supplier information (master) and the orders placed with that supplier (detail)

- Maintenance of an asset - one asset has many maintenance records
	- Display the asset (master), and the maintenance performed on it (detail)

- Order detail - One order has many detail lines
	- Display the order (master), and the products ordered (detail)

Options to create a form/subform
- Form Wizard
- Form Design
#### Using form wizard to create form/subform with datasheet
Use the kelsey vets database for the next few examples
1. Click "Create tab"
2. Form Wizard
3. Select `tblVisit` and select all fields
4. Select `tblVistDetails` and select all fields
5. How to view
	- `By tblVisits` gives options for form with subform

6. Layout for subform?
	- Datasheet

7. Names on the forms
	- `frmVisits`
	- `subFrmVisitDetails`

8. Modify the form's design
	- Adjustments
		- Remove the label
		- Align the subform with the main form (Drag to left)
		- View the form and realize it's content does not fit the window/columns and resize it to fit
