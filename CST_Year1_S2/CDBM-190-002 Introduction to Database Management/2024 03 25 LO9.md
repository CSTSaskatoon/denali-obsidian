    strFilter = Me.txtFilter.value
    strFilterCol = Me.cboFilter.value
    strlookupcol = Me.cboLookup.value

    Dim value2 As Integer
    Dim result As Integer
    value1 = CInt(Me.txtNum1)
    value2 = CInt(Me.txtNum2)
    If value1 > value2 Then
    result = Me.txtNum2.value & " is greater than " & Me.txtNum2.value
    ElseIf value2 > value2 Then
    result = Me.txtNum1.value & " is greater than " & Me.txtNum1.value
    Else
    result = "They are the same"
    End If
    
    Me.txtResult.value = result
