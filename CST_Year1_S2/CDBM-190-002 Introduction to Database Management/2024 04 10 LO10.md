# Union Queries
Both tables/queries must have the same number of fields and must be compatible types
Entire UNION statement can only have one ORDER BY clause
Don't need to include DISTINCT because UNION queries don't return duplicate rows
Can add an "All" option to a combo box, create a UNION statement that unites the original query with a query that only brings back the option "All"
*Example*
```SQL
SELECT Customer.Country
FROM Customer
SELECT '(All)'
FROM Customer
ORDER BY Customer.Country;
```
