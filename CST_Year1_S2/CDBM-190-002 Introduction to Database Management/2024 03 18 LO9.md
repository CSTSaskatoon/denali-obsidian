# VBA in access
We will *Not* be using macros in this class
### 9.1 Why use VBA?
To create user-defined functions and procedures to perform complex actions repeatedly
To create complex data management features
- Make transactions

Create more sophisticated user interface requirements
- More complex forms
- Graceful error handling
### 9.2 Different types of VBA Modules
A module consists of a declarations section and one or more procedures/functions
#### Form Module
Created along with the form and contains code that responds to events that occur as a result of the user interacting with the form
#### Report Module
Same as form, but for reports
Less useful
#### Standard Module
Created to contain general procedures and functions that aren't associated with a particular form
#### Class Module
used to create custom objects (*We won't use*)
#### Procedure
Series of VBA statements grouped together to complete a task
##### Event Procedures
Associated with the form and report event buttons (button clicks, list sections, etc.)
##### Custom Procedures
Not associated directly with the event but instead called by other code
##### Function
Custom procedure that returns a single value (*Basically, procedures are void, functions return something*)
### 9.5 VBA Code Window Components

1. Project Explorer - shows modules in the current access file
2. Properties window - shows properties for current form, only available in design view
3. Object list (*Don't use, makes stupid procedures*) - navigate through controls on the form
4. Procedure list (*Don't use, makes stupid events*) - all events for a control that you can pick from
