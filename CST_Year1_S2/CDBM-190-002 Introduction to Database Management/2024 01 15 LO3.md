# Apply Database Relationships to Maintain data Integrity
### Two most common Keys are
- *Primary Key* - Consists of one or more fields whose contents uniquely identify each record in the table
- *Foreign Key* - a field in a table (Child Table) that is based on a PK on another table (Parent Table)
- *Composite Key* (Concatenated Key) - When a primary key is comprised of two or more fields
### Characteristics of a Primary Key (PK)
- All values in the primary key are unique, and therefore you cannot enter any duplicates
- The PK is used to link two different tables
- All PK's are indexed - this speeds up any queries searches or sorts
- PK cannot be null
- PK is located in the parent table
### Characteristics of a Foreign Key (FK)
- The data / datatype in the child tables PK must hold the same data/datatype as the PK field in the parent table (**Can't do one PK with a Long integer and one with a short Integer**)
- The FK in the child table does not **NEED** to be named the same as the PK in the parent table, but it is good practice

### Entity
Anything that can have an independent existence
They represent the table in *Entity Relationship Diagram* (*ERD*)
An ERD is used to model a real world scenario

### Recognize Relationship types
#### Crows Foot notation - type of ERD

Cardinality can have two options (Diagrams)
#### Mordality/Ordinality
- ![20](Pasted%20image%2020240115093621.png) Indicates minimum number is Zero and the relationship is optional
- ![10](Pasted%20image%2020240115093651.png) Indicates minimum number is One and the relationship is mandatory
#### Relationships

One or More ![](Pasted%20image%2020240115093817.png)
One and only One ![](Pasted%20image%2020240115093923.png)

### Implement Relationship types
Connections between tables are called relationships and are made on common values
Note that you have to distinguish between relationships (connections) and and relations (tables)
#### One-To-Many
Occurs when a single row in one table (parent) is linked to zero or more rows in another table (child)
Parent table is on the one side and child is on the many side in a 1:M or 1:N relationship

customer places many orders
