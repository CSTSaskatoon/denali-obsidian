### Standard Constructs
Control Structures
- if
- if/else
- Nested if
- if/else if
Control Structures (repetition)
- while
- do/while
- for
- Note for the enhanced for ... each, but in ES2015+, there is a *for/of* stucture to traverse the array
	- For/of is preffered as it's more flexible
	- for/or does not proveide an index and can't change anything
- Also provides *for/in* structure to loop through object properties - **Don't mix up with for/of**
