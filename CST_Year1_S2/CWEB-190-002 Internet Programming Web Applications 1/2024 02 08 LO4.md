# Notes
### Document Object Model
There is a document object model (DOM) and browser object model (BOM)
The DOM grew out of the development of browser where developers provided different API features for accessing web pages
- This was eventually standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) 
The DOM provides access to the web page being displayed 
The BOM provides access to the browser itself 
We will be working with the DOM in this course
t the top of the object model is the window object
This is the current browser window
- We've already referred to window methods
	- Window.alert()
- Some others
- confirm(): displays a yes-or-no dialog box 
- prompt () : provides a prompt dialog box 
- setTimeout () : schedules code to be executed after a specified amount of time 
- open(): opens a new window displaying a specified URL 
- close(): closes the window
Within the window is a property called ‘history’
This contains the browser history of visited URLs 
Methods: 
- history.back() 
- history.forward() 
- history.go() with a positive or negative number as parameter 
The window also contains a location property 
- Information regarding the currently displayed page 
- We can 
	- Read the value of the location object 
	- Assign a value to the location object to change it and update the history 
	- Assign a value to the location object using the replace() method which doesn’t update history
Navigator — we won’t be working with this window property but important to mention it because ... its usually wrong! 
Screen — this describes the computer screen and its properties 
- Most used properties of screen are availHeight and availWidth 
	- availHeight - computer screen height in pixels 
	- availWidth - computer screen width in pixels 
The document property
- Internal representation of the page currently displayed 
- Various properties and methods provided to interact with this page 
- The level 0 DOM (original DOM spec)
So to access the fourth image on a page, you use: 
- document. images\[3] 
- This has the advantage of being simple and straightforward Disadvantages: 
	- Not the most scalable mode of access 
	- The list on the previous page is incomplete
	- There are many more items on a web page than just that list 
- There is a better way provided by the DOM
#### The DOM also provides a tree like representation of an HTML document

#### More Notes
Additionally, each element can have several attributes
These are generally referred to the same as their attribute
- ie. *p* for paragraph has an *id* attribute so *p.id*
Exceptions where attribute names confict with reserved words
- class -> className
- for -> htmlFor
#### More ways to get references
We can reference these elements and we've already seen how
- document.getElementById()
We can also store the result in a variable
- let p = document.getElemetById()
In our case, we can use the following to get a reference to the particular p element on our page
- let p = document.getElementById("para");
There are other similar methods that can be used to reference elements
- getElementsByTagName()
- getElementsByClassName()
- querySelector()
- querySelectorAll()
#### Trees
##### Tree terminology
- Any element can have child nodes, a parent node and sibling nodes
- Parent Node - most closely encloses the element, immediately above in hierarchy
- Child Node - any elements immediately enclosed by an element
	- Other enclosed elements below this are sometimes referred as descendants
- Sibling Node - other elements with the same parent
There are a few special properties that each element also has
- parent
- childNodes\[]
- firstChild
- lastChild
- nextSibling
- previousSibling
In our example, p.parent would return a reference to the body element
We can get a reference to the *strong* element using p.childNodes\[1]
p.firstChild refers to Text - "You can call me "
p.lastChild would reference Text - " mother fucker"
If we had a reference *s* storing a reference to *strong* then s.nextSibling would point to " mother fucker"

#### Creating new Elements
There are  few steps
- create the element you want to add
- Add it to your document model

If we want to add an additional paragraph with some text
- two seperate things
- Element 1 = \<p>
- Element 2 = Text ... which would be a child of element 1
- So first create a \<p> element, then create a text element
- Make the text a child of \<p> and then add the \<p> to the document

We'll add our paragraph immediately following the existing one so we need to get a reference to that paragraph's parent, the \<body> element
- `let oldP = document.getElementById("para");`
- `let body = oldP.parentNode;`

Now that we have a reference to the \<body> element we can add the new paragraph by appending
- `body.appendChild(newP);`

Can also replace content using `replaceChild();`
- `body.replaceChild(newP, oldP);`

replace the original paragraph with the new one
# HTML and JS
#### Opening Windows
```JS
window.onload = () => {  

		// Opens new window with whatever link you want
		// If you don't put a site in, it will just be a blank window
    document.getElementById("newWindow").onclick = function () {  
        window.open("https://youtube.com/@spoonkid2169");  
    }  

		// Takes you back to whatever your previous history was
		// Doesn't work if you are in a new window (No back arrow in top left)
    document.getElementById("goBack").onclick = function () {  
        history.back();  
    }  

		// Just displays the site you are on
    document.getElementById("displayLocation").onclick = function () {  
        alert(window.location);  
    }  

		// If you use .assign, you DO get browser history
    document.getElementById("assignLocation").onclick = function () {  
        window.location.assign("https://youtube.com/@spoonkid2169");  
    }  

		// If you use .replace, you DON'T get browser history, it just replaces your current site with the new one
    document.getElementById("callReplace").onclick = function () {  
        window.location.replace("https://youtube.com/@blazedrust");  
    }  
  
  
}
```
#### Resize function
##### Old version
```JS
document.getElementById("resize").onclick = function () {  
    let myWindow;  
    
    myWindow.open("","", 100, 100);  
    
    let winWidth = 500;  
    let winHeight = 400;  
    let screenWidth = screen.availWidth;  
    let screenHeight = screen.availHeight;
      
    window.resizeTo(winWidth, winHeight);  
    
    let hPosition = (screenWidth - winWidth) /2;  
    let vPosition = (screenHeight - winHeight) /2;  
    
    window.moveTo(hPosition, vPosition);  
    
    myWindow.resizeTo(400, 300);  
    myWindow.focus();  
}
```
##### New version
```JS
let myWindow;  
  
function openWin() {  
    myWindow = window.open("","","width=100,height=100");  
}  
  
function resizeWin() {  
    myWindow.resizeTo(500,400);  
    myWindow.focus();  
}
```
*Functions that actually do the resizing*
```JS
document.getElementById("resize").onclick = function () {  
  
    resizeWin();  
}  
document.getElementById("open").onclick = function () {  
    openWin();  
}
```
*These ones just call the functions that do the resizing*
