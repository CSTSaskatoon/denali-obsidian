you can have defaults in your method headers
Ex.
```JS
function asPercent(numerator, denominator, digits = 1) {  
    return (numerator/denominator * 100).toFixed(digits) + "%";  
}
```
doing digits = 1 means that if you put use asPercent with only 2 variables it will assume you want it to one decimal place. This can be overwritten by still putting in a value, say you wanted the percentage to 2 digits
### Event-driven JavaScript
![600](Pasted%20image%2020240123131514.png)
At some point, we need to be able to respond to user interactions like clicking menus and buttons, mouse overs etc
Requires discussion of *events*
Whenever teh user does something to directly interact with the browser by moving the mouse, clicking on something or using the keyboard, the browser generates an event
We can specify that specific functions get executed when specific events occur (*event handlers*)
```HTML
<body>
	<p>
		<input type="button" value="Click me!" />
	</p>
</body>
```
This is very simple in that it just displays a button
If click the button
- An event is generated by the browser but since we have no code associated with it, it appears but nothing happens
- Change the code to add
```HTML
<input type="button" value="Click me mother fucker" onclick="alert('first handler mother fucker');" />
```
Now we see an alert, but this is regarded as bad because you are inline scripting
instead, add it to JS
```JS
function showAlert() {  
    alert('Fuck off')  
}  
  
button.onclick = showAlert;
```
If you have a function like this,  don't have the brackets on showAlert when you call it (*showAlert()*) because it will just execute showAlert immediately instead of waiting for the button click
#### Event handler vs listener
with an event handler, you can do button.onclick = showAlert
with an event listener you can do button.addEventListener("click", showAlert)
they look similar, but event listener lets you assign multiple functions to the same event/object, whereas you can't with an even handler
#### Common Events/Handlers
![600](Pasted%20image%2020240123134700.png)
*Most of the time, event handlers will start with "on", and the listeners will be the same without the "on"*
#### window.onload
If you have everything in functions, have a windows.onload event handler that calls all the functions you want so it only starts the functions after HTML/CSS is loaded
