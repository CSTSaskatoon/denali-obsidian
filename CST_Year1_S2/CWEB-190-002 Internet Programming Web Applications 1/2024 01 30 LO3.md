# Objects in JavaScript
### Date Objects
JS has built in classes for various kinds of objects
We can use a built in class to create Date objects
- let currentDate = new Date();
Can also create specific dates using strings and numbers
```JS
let birthday = new Date("May 12, 1970")
let yourBDay = new Date(1970,5,12);
```
- Last one doesn't quite work as months are zero indexed
#### Testing
```JS
let current = new Date();
current // Outputs the date, time, and time zone

```
### Image Objects
JS has an image object that can be used to store an image internally
useful if you want to preload images
We can look at an example where we switch images with an event
- Slight delay when the second image ahs to load
pretty much eliminates any delay
### Arguments object
like public static void man(String\[] args)
is an object not an array
### Rest Syntax
As of ES6, rest syntax is preferred to arguments object
Rest Syntax means "the rest of the arguments"
Defined by specifying a parameter name which begins with an elliplsis
- ...myArgs
can be used by itself or after any other parameters
- can only be one
- must be the last parameter
Unlike the argument object it's an actual array
### JS Objects
```JS
let myObj = new Object(); // Has nothing in it
myObj.name = "FUCK"; // Assign whatever values you want to whatever properties you want
```
By executing an assignment to a non-existent property, we create it and assign the value
- Dot notation (.name)
- treat the object as an associative array (myObj["name])
- Also referred to as key-value pairs
- here, *name* is the key and value it stores is the *FUCK*
Other way to make properties/values when creating an object
```JS
let student = {name: "FUCK",GPA: 9999999, courses: ["COSC190","COSA190","CWEB190","HELL"]}
```
```JS
let fieldname = "name";
student[fieldname]; // outputs 'FUCK'
```
```JS
student.enrol = function() {
	return "I enrolled";
}
```

We can iterate through the properties of an object using the for/in loop
