# Ajax - Dynamically updating web pages
### What is AJAX
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
Provides solution to the problem of making web pages more dynamic without reloading
Basic idea
- Portion of code is written to request external data and update a portion of the page automatically
	- Update happens after the request response is received

- Don't reload anything - only the part affected by the request is updated
- User should be able to use the page as usual while this happens in the background

AJAX will receive some data in XML
Data is stored or inserted into the page somehow
XML has largely been replaced by JSON as the de facto standard for web data
### How AJAX Works
Browsers support `XMLHttpRequest`
- object with properties and methods to make AJAX requests - Note *XHR*

Setup
- create `XMLHttpRequest` object
- Config the object telling it what and how to fetch (may use GET and POST)
- set up event handler to handle the response
- Send the request
- Do whatever until the response comes back

Object includes state machine that handles processing
States
- Request Initialized
- Connection established
- Server received request - No processing
- Server finished processing
- Response received from server
- Ready state change event fires after each stage
- Generally only care about the last one

we will use the *Fetch API* to make this easier
- *`fetch()` and `then()`*
### Fetch API
*`Fetch()`* makes request to URL
- takes string url or request object as a required parameter
- Can be configured with optional objects as a second parameter

Will return a "promise" - eventual completion of an asynchronous event
Once the response is received from the request, the "promise" is fulfilled and some code will process the result
- Done by chaining `.then()` onto the original `fetch()`

*`Then()`* contains a function which accepts the response from the `fetch()` as a parameter
- can chain together multiple `then()` calls to create separate stages of processing

`Fetch('            ').then(function(response) {function stuff})`
