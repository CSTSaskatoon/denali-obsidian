# Notes
### JavaScript Validation
instead of doing the `required` attribute in HTML, you can validate this on the JS side by checking if the contents of the field are blank
if it is blank, then call `event.preventDefault();` and show an error message to the user.
#### Other Events
`onSubmit` isn't the only event that you can do this with, you can validate on a lot of different event triggers
`onclick` can be used on lots of different elements, not just buttons
`onchange`/`oninput 
- triggers after a field has been changed/something is selected
- `onchange` only triggers after you leave the field
- `oninput` triggers while the field has focus (every letter you type)

`onfocus/onblur`
- triggers when entering (`onfocus`) or leaving (`onblur`) a field
### Regular Expressions
[RegexOne](https://www.regexone.com)
[Regex101](https://regex101.com)
check against a string to see if it matches a pattern
Ex. valid email, phone number, SIN, etc.
#### 3 main ways JS uses regular expressions
2 String methods - search and match
##### `string.search(/    /)`
search 'string' to see if the pattern in brackets exists in the string
```js
let str = "Michael";
let index = str.search(/ch/);
```
returns the index of the first index found
`match()` works the same but returns an array of all the instance indexes it finds
"Ron has been at Saskpoly for 20 years"
- `string.search(/as/)` - returns 5
- `string.match(/as/)` - returns `[5,17]`

Can also construct an expression and call a test() method off of it to check strings to see if the string matches the expression
- `/bob/.test("Bobobo")` - will return true

can include flags after the expressions
- *i* - ignore case
- *g* - global search (don't stop after the first match)
- *m* - multiline mode
- Ex. `/bob/i.test("Bobobo")`
