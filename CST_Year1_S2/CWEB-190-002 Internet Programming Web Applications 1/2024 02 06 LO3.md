```JS
function readValues() {  
    // get the values from text fields into the two variables  
    const name = nameInput.value;  
    const mark = parseFloat(markInput.value);  
  
    // Construct an object containing those two values  
    // plus a toString to output them    return {  
        "name": name,  
        "mark":mark,  
        "toString":function(){  
            return "Student [ name= " + this.name + ", mark=" + this.mark + " ]";  
        }  
    }  
}
```

```JS
function processValues() {  
    // Variables:   object to store the returned data  
    //              String to use to create the list items    let result;  
    let strResults = "";  
  
    // Read the result from the input boxes and add to array (call readValues)  
    result = readValues();  
    alert(result.name = "\n" + result.mark + "\n" + result.toString());  
    arResults[counter++] = result;  
  
    // Sort the array results descending by mark  
    arResults.sort((x,y)=> y.mark - x.mark);  
  
    // loop through the array to construct the string  
    // for the ordered list <li></li>    for(let i=0; i<counter; i++) {  
        strResults += "<li>" + arResults[i].name + " " + arResults[i].mark + "</li>";

*calls the method above*
Object literals can be used to encapsulate data  
fields into a single object and be used as an input  
Parameters and return values  
Can be accessed with either dot notation or as associative arrays using key:value syntax  
Key must be enclosed in "" or processed as a variable  
can contain objects as with other objects  
object literals have no prototype property as they are constructed without a constructor
### Objects in JS
Important points regarding object literals
- You can leave out the quotation marks on property names if there is no space in the name
- Object literals have no prototype chain because no constructor is used

Object literals have been used to standardize an object notation in the form JavaScript Object Notation or JSON
JSON allows an object state to be saved and read later
with JSON, an object could be saved form one language, transferred to another computer and reopened in a completely different system
#### Differences between JSON and object literals
in JSON, all keys must be surrounded by double quotes
with object literals, single quotes or no quotes is fine (sometimes)
in JSON, functions can't be stored in an object
in JSON, you can't use function calls or variables
JSON allows you to specify either object or array literals
- JSON objects - used to represent an unordered set of key-value pairs
- JSON arrays - used to represent an ordered list of values
- JSON arrays can also store objects

We can nest these rules
```JS
myObj = {
	"name": "John",
	"age":30,
	"cars": [
	{"name":"Ford","models": ["Fiesta","Focus","Mustang"]},
	{"name":"BMW","models":["320","X3","X5"]}.
	{"name":"Fiat","models":["500","Panda"]}
	]
}
```
**The cars array is part of an anonymous object**
```JS
let car = Object();  
car.make = "Dodge";  
car.model = "Dart";  
car.year = 1974;  
car.color = "Blue";  
```
*first way to make an object*
```JS
let obj = {  
    "make": "Dodge",  
    "model": "Dart",  
    "year": 1974,  
    "color": "Blue",  
    "options": ["Power Windows","Power Steering"],  
    "toString": function(){}  
};
```
*Second way to make an object*
```JSON
*Two methods of making an object*
[  
  {  
    "make": "Dodge",  
    "model": "Dart",  
    "year": 1974,  
    "color": "Blue",  
    "options": ["Power Windows","Power Steering"],  
  },  
  {  
      
  }  
]
```
*JSON version - notice you can't have a function in a JSON file*
```JSON
{  
  "name": "Mike",  
  "office": "240.5",  
  "quirks": "beardy",  
  "classes": ["CWEB180","CWEB190"],  
  "program": "CST"  
},
```
*making an Instructor object in JSON*
You don't put **ANY** code in a JSON file, it's only for data
