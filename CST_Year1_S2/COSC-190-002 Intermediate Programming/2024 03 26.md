## Assignment Notes
Should have made player runnable, use a new threadpool and wait for shutdown before comparing hands to dealer
## Sockets
### Description
![](Pasted%20image%2020240326090221.png)
A socket is a mechanism that allows for communications between 2 remote applications
All languages have some level of support for socket programming
Java uses the standard File IO Processing techniques for communications
### Under the hood
![](Pasted%20image%2020240326090340.png)
2^16 different ports (0 - 65,635)
[Wikipedia list of port numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers)
### Complete Packet

### Programming Abstraction
don't have to make a packet from scratch
Support for sockets in java simplifies the process
Should recognize we are working with Client/Server protocol
- Fairly standardized programming Abstraction
### Practice
#### Server
generally stay above 10k for port numbers
making a server
- `ServerSocket obServer = new ServerSocket(PORT_NUM);`

*Waiting for a connection*
- `Socket obSock = obServer.accept();`
- Blocking call which sits and wait for incoming connections
- Will return a new socket which acts like a file handler
- Assigned a random port number

*Data output stream*
- `DataOutputStream obOut = new DataOutputStream(obSock.getOutputStream());`
#### Client
*Get port number from server and Host IP is loopback*
```java
private static int portNum = Server1.PORT_NUM;  
private static String sHost = "127.0.0.1";
```
*Client Socket*
- `Socket obSock = new Socket(sHost, portNum);`

*Get message from server*
```java
DataInputStream obIn = new DataInputStream(obSock.getInputStream());  
System.out.printf("Got message\n%s",obIn.readUTF());
```
#### Better Server Connection
```java
while(true) {  
    Socket obSock = obServer.accept(); // Will not go on from this step until a connection is made  
    new Thread(()-> {  
        DealWithCon(obSock);  
    }).start();  
}
```
Instead of getting one connection and then turning off like before, this server will stay up even after it makes a connection, starting a new thread for all new connections
*`DealWtihCon`* just does the same data output stream and write action as before
