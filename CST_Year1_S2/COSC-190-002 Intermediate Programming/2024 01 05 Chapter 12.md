## RegexTester
(?i) - ignore case
all "_the_ " with "_light_" following it
(?i)(\bthe\b) (?!light) - all "_the_" without "_light_" following it
(?i)(?<=the) (light) - all "_light_" as long as "_the_ " is before it
For CSV files, if you want to include commas in your phrase then you need to surround it in quotes. 
Pattern we will use for this - _,(?=([^\"]*\"[^\"]*\")*(?![^\"]*\"))_
###### Ex. 
	First,Last  
	"Simon, on the lake",Canada  
	Gene,"Outside, PA"
### Splitting a line
The method parseCSVLine will split up a line regardless of whether double quotes were included as a part of this
We will then remove the double quotes from the example
```JAVA
public static String[] parseCSVLine(String sLine)  
{  
    String sPattern = ",(?=([^\"]*\"[^\"]*\")*(?![^\"]*\"))";  
    String[] sFields = sLine.split(sPattern);  
	
    for(int i=0; i<sFields.length; i++)  
    {  
        sFields[i] = sFields[i].replace("\"", "");  
    }  
    return sFields;  
}
```
### In class Example
Design a car class that will have attributes for _make_, _model_, _year_, and _price_ as appropriate
The class should include a constructor that takes in an _Array of Strings_ that correspond to the data that we found in cars.xls
"Make","Model","Year","Price"
Note that we are going to have used _Integer.parseInt_ and _Double.parseDouble_ to convert the values correctly
