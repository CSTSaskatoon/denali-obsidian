# Notes
## JavaFX stuff
### Setting up a GridPane
```java
GridPane obPane = new GridPane();  
obPane.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER);  
obPane.setPadding(new Insets(5,5,5,5));
```
Pretty standard to center and add padding for a GridPane
## Events
You can make a class to handle the events, but it's better to do a lambda
