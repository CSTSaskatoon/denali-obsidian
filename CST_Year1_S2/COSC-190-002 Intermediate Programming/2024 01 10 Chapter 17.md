### Different Streams
DataInputStream/DataOutputStream allow you to do primitive level operations
- Write an int or a UTFString
- All associated with primitive data types except for Strings
ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream allow you to do object based writes
- Don't have to have a specific method for going through and writing parts of the object out
- The Object Stream classes also have all the methods associated with Data Stream
- Can use methods associated with the Data Stream 
### The serialize Interface
### Writing objects using input/output streams
#### Writing to a .obj file
Basically the same as .bin files, but you do ObjectOutputStream instead of DataOutputStream and obOut.writeObject(obCar) instead of your usual obOut.writeInt(nInt)
#### Reading from a .obj file
Will need to do a while(true) loop to read the whole file. When it reaches the end, it will throw a EOFExcpetion which we need to catch
### Random Access Files (RAF)

Allows you to write and read when you need to
if we want to go to write object representations to RAF so that we can read them from a particular point there are things to consider
every record has to be the *Exact same size*, if Strings are too big they need to be chopped off.
different from a .obj file, you can't just do .writeObject you have to manually configure each String, int, double and whatever you want in a very precise way. If one record is even a little bit off it will throw everything off
This is why we need to limit String length
#### Strings
limit the length of the string, lose information if you go over the limit, have empty bits if you don't write it long enough
make an array of bytes for the string, and then write the bytes to the RAF until you either run out of 'size' that was set in the beginning, or the String is done writing
If the String is done writing but there is still space left before it hits the 'size' limit, add the *TERM_CHAR ('\\0')* until it gets to the size
Essentially, this means that all strings will be the same byte size as long as you set the same size every time
### File Pointer
pointer starts at the beginning of the file when you open it
When you read or write, the pointer goes to right after where your read/write finished
you can use .seek(position in bytes) to go to a specific point in the file
