### Text vs Binary
Text Files
- Information is stored as Unicode values
- Numbers have to be converted to their Unicode values when writing in txt files
Binary
- Store information in the same format as the running program
## Binary Files
Advantages
- Quicker to read/write
- Smaller in size
Disadvantages
- Can't read in notepad
- Reading/writing files
Binary I/O classes
*InputStream and OutputStream are both abstract classes*
