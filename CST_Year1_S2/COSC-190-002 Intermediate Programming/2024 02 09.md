# Var Keyword
This reserved word allows you to declare variables without identifying their type
- Feature in known as type inference 
- Somewhat like JavaScript 

Var variables are local to a particular block of code 
- We cannot have a method UG ERETg
- We cannot create an array of var 
- We cannot have a var variable as a method parameter type 
- The system will do a cast for us if we pass the variable to a method
# Working with anonymous Objects
We can have a var type that refers to a list of objects
Suppose we want to go through the BattleShip entries and create a list of anonymous objects that individually represent the Name and The Navy only of all battleships that are dreadnaughts
The associated program does exactly that using var and the notion of anonymous objects
# Map Collection
Also called a *Hash* - this will map to a particular position in a collection
- Look up based on key value
- Standard methods are put, get
- Map allows for forEach
- You will learn more about hash maps in second year
# Grouping By
The elements in a stream can be divided into groups by using the groupingBy collector
The first argument in the groupingBy method will specify the criteria for grouping (*classifier*)
Second element specifies how the group is processed
- Usually the process is a summary process such as counting or averaging
If not existant, will return the stream element
# Code
```java
var aVals = {19,12,12};  
var[] aVals = {19, 12, 12};
```
*We can't make an array of var*
```java
private static var someFunc(int nVal)
```
also can't make a method with it because it's not a parameter
