### Problem
want know the count of all ships that were built after 1930 that participated in WW2
you can do this 2 ways
- The old way using a foreach loop
Stream-based approach
- Much more concise
- More declarative (specifies explicitly what we are trying to do)
### Method References
Another form of Lambda expression that is quite compact
- you can replace your lambda expression with the method reference
Reference to a static method
- ContainingClass::staticMethodName
Reference to an instance method
- InstanceObject::MethodName
Reference to a constructor
- ClassName::new
### Stream Rationale
Collections are the most heavily used API in Java
- Data processing usually involves working with reams and reams of data
Business/Technical logic entails work with database like operations for grouping/filtering the data
- SQL queries
- Would be nice if we could focus less on explicitly implementing queries and instead express what you want
For large datasets it is much more efficient if we process the data in parallel
- Much harder
### What are Streams
Streams are un update to the Java API that lets you manipulate collections of data in a declarative way
- You express a query rather than an ad-hoc implementation
- Fancy iterators over a collection of data
Streams allow you to process the data in parallel quite easily
- Takes advantage of Modern CPU capabilities
### Streams vs Collections
Collections can be used to provide streams so what are the differences
Streams are interfaces to data structures representing a sequenced set of values
- step through them
Like watching movie on a DVD vs streaming
### Important Notes
Streams are immutable - you can copy it but can't modify the elements in the stream
For programming, a program will only extract the elements from the stream as they are produced
- Producer-consumer application
Can only be traversed once
- If you have to reprocess you have to create a new stream
Streams use internal iteration
- handles stepping through the individual elements with iteration by programmer
- You let it handle the steps
- Steps might not go in the sequence you expect
If you are working with the elements in a collection - you are doing *external iteration*
- programmer has to specify how the iteration proceeds
### Intermediate vs Terminal Operations
As far as streams are concerned, we have the notion of an intermediate operations
- The input to an intermediate operation will be a stream - the output will also be a stream
- You can have as many intermediate operations as you want
- Cannot be the final operation of the stream
Final or terminal operations are different
- can only be one final operation
- Must be the last operation of the stream
### List of Intermediate Operations
![700](Pasted%20image%2020240202102501.png)
limit - limits the amount that can be returned
distinct - only returns values that are unique
### Terminal Operations
![700](Pasted%20image%2020240202102822.png)
### Mapping
Mapping is one of the more interesting intermediate operations
- Since mapping usually involves reducing the available information to smaller data points, it's often referred to as *map reduction*
- The map intermediate operation will take in a Function<T,R> reference and pass the result to the next part of the stream
```java
lstShip.stream()
.map(x-> x.getName())
.forEach(System.out::println);
```
### Specific Map Reductions
addition map intermediate Operations
- mapToDouble, mapToInteger, mapToLong
- These pass Number values along - 
- We can use *.average(), .count(), .min(), and .max() for analysis*
```Java
Double dval = lstShip.stream()
	.mapToDouble(x-> x.getDisplacement())
	.average(.getAsDouble);
```
### Optional return Values
Used to parse the only value that is present in the stream
- average is going to reduce the stream size to a single value
- Problem is we don't know what kind of value might be produced if any from the above statement
- The genrical optional class was developed as an alternate way of forcing people to check for nulls
### The Collect Process
Most involved of all the terminal operations
- used when we want to collect the stream into a new collection
- Simplest of these is to return a new list implementation
- Has a series of static methods for generating collections
#### We can also force the result into a particular type of collection
```java
ArrayList<BattleShip> obRN = obShipList.stream()
	.filter(x -> x.getNavy().matches("^*Royal Navy.*$"))
	.collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new))
```
### The Reduce Operation
The reduce operation allows us to produce 1 single result from a sequence of operations
- used often to sum values or create a String representation
Typical reduce operation that might be summing number might look like
- .reduce(0, (x,y) -> x+y)
The 0, called the identity is the initial value of the reduction and the return value returned if the string is empty
The second part of this is a BiFunction (*Accumulator*) that returns the partial/full result of all the accumulations you want to work with
**This is a Terminal Operation**
#### Reduce Examples
Another way of summing for a stream that results in a number
.reduce(0, Integer::sum)
Say we want to concatenate strings together with :
.reduce("",(x,y) -> x+ ":"  + y)
# Code Examples
### Basic Integer and name String example
```java
public static void main(String[] args)  
{  
    ArrayList<Integer> lstInteger = new ArrayList<>();  
      
    for(int i=0; i<100; i++) {  
        lstInteger.add((int) (Math.random()*500));  
    }    
    lstInteger.stream().limit(10).forEach(System.out::println);  
}
```
*Notice how the order in which we call the Intermediate Operations does not matter unless the method is a Terminal Operation (forEach)*
*.stream() ALWAYS needs to be the first Operation*
```Java
lstInteger.stream().sorted().limit(10).forEach(System.out::println);
```
*Prints just the first 10 Integers from the sorted list*
```java
lstInteger.stream().sorted().filter(e-> e>10).limit(10).forEach(System.out::println);
```
*Prints the first 10 elements in the sorted array that **ARE GREATER THAN 10** because of the .filter*
```Java
long lCount = lstInteger.stream().filter(e-> e>200).count();
```
*Prints out the count of how many Integers are greater than 200 in the list*
**NOTE:** *Must be a long as that's what .count returns*
```java
String[] saNames = {"Blazed","Spoonkid","Dave","Luckyllama","Dinkbot","WillJum","HJune"};  
List<String> nameList = Arrays.asList(saNames);
nameList.stream().sorted((x,y) ->y.compareTo(x)).limit(5).forEach(System.out::println);
```
*Prints out the first 5 sorted names*
```Java
nameList.stream()  
        .sorted((x,y) ->y.compareTo(x))  
        .limit(5)  
        .forEach(System.out::println);
```
*This does the exact same thing as up above, just with the Operations on new lines*
### BattleShip Example
```java
public static Function<String, BattleShip> ldBB = x-> new BattleShip(funcUtils.parseCSVLine(x));  
```
*Function*
```Java
public static void main(String[] args)  
{  
    ArrayList<BattleShip> lstBB = funcUtils.loadList("Files/Battleships.csv",ldBB);   
    long lVal = lstBB.stream()  
            .count();  
    System.out.printf("There are %d ships\n",lVal);  
}
```
*Main method, coutnts the number of battleships*
```java
lVal = lstBB.stream()  
        .filter(x->x.getType().equals("dreadnought"))  
        .count();  
System.out.printf("There are %d dreadnoughts in the list\n",lVal);
```
*counts how many dreadnoughts there are in the list based on the filter*
```java
lVal = lstBB.stream()  
        .filter(x -> x.getNavy().matches("^*Royal Navy.*$"))  
        .count();  
System.out.printf("There are %d ships in the Royal Navy\n",lVal);
```
*Counts how many Royal Navy ships are in the list based on a RegEx String*
```java
long lDisplacement = lstBB.stream()  
        .filter(x-> x.getDisplacement()>40000)  
        .count();  
System.out.printf("There are %d ships with a displacement over 40000 tons\n",lDisplacement);
```
*Counts the number of ships which have a displacement over 40000 tons*
```java
List<BattleShip> lstRN = lstBB.stream()  
        .filter(x -> x.getNavy().matches("^*Royal Navy.*$"))  
        .collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new));  
lstRN.forEach(System.out::println);
```
*returns an ArrayList of Battleships that are in the Royal Navy*
### Summary
You always need .stream() first
**You must have a Terminal Operator**, you can only have 1 and it must be last as it ends the stream
The order in which you call the *Intermediate Operators* does not matter
the Operation names are pretty self-explanatory
