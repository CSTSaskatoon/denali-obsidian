# DIMM and SO-DIMM
Memory used in laptops
- Modern laptops use DDR4, DDR3L, or DDR3 SO-DIMM memory

You can only use the type of memory your laptop is made to support
The number of pins and the position of the notches on a SO-DIMM keep you from inserting the wrong module in a memory slot
SIMM - electrically the same on both sides of the module
SO-DIMM - small form factor of DIMM, for laptops
# Virtual RAM
Virtual memory is the way windows uses space on the hard drive to enhance the amount of RAM in a system
Windows normally stores virtual memory in `pagefile.sys`, a hidden file stored in the root directory of drive C:
Not having enough free space on drive C: can cause `pagefile.sys` to be too small, resulting in a low memory warning
# Upgrading Memory
Means adding more memory to the computer
- Involves replacing current memory a lot of the time
### Adding more RAM might solve
- Slow performance
- Applications refusing to load
- An unstable system
- Windows "insufficient Memory" error
### WILL NOT SOLVE
- All issues
- If you aren't using all your current RAM, adding more won't do anything
- Lowest common denominator will be what the system runs ALL RAM at
# How much memory do I need and how much is currently installed?
Consider the limitations of the motherboard, processor, and OS
Limitations when considering the OS
- Windows requires at least 1GB for a 32-bit install and 2GB for 64-bit
- for 64-bit, Windows 10 Pro can support up to 2TB of memory
- 32-bit on windows 10/8/7 can only support 4GB of memory
### What type of memory is already installed
1. Open the case and look at the memory slots
	- How many slots do you have
	- How many are filled
	- Review module imprint

2. Examine the motherboard for the imprinted manufacturer and model
3. Read motherboard documentation to see if the board supports dual, triple or quad channels
### How many/what type of modules can fit on my motherboard?
Read motherboard documentation to find out how much memory the motherboard can hold
DIMM modules can be installed as single modules, but wonâ€™t be as productive
To get the full benefit of DDR4 dual-channel DIMMS, install matching DIMMs in each channel
For a motherboard using DDR3 triple-channel DIMMs, use three matching DIMMs in the three blue slots
- If the fourth slot is populated, the board reverts to single channeling
### Selecting and purchasing memory modules
Compromises might be necessary, if the exact match is not available but keep the following in mind when selecting memory modules:
- Mixing unbuffered memory with buffered or registered memory will not work
- Match the memory module manufacturer, if possible
- If mixing memory speeds, all modules will perform at the slowest speed

Use a web site to research your purchase
- Look for a search utility that will match memory modules to your motherboard
# Installing Memory
Pull out supporting arms on the sides of the slot
Use notches on DIMM edge connector as a guide
Insert DIMM straight down into the slot
When the DIMM is fully inserted, the supporting clips pop back into place
When the computer powers up, it counts the memory present
- You can enter BIOS/UEFI to verify that the memory is recognized
# Upgrading memory on a laptop
Before upgrading memory on a laptop, make sure the warranty is not being voided
- Search for best buy on a suitable and authorized part

Upgrading memory on a laptop is similar to upgrading memory on a desktop
- Decide how much memory to upgrade
- Purchase memory
- Install it

Be sure to match the type of memory to the type the laptop supports
