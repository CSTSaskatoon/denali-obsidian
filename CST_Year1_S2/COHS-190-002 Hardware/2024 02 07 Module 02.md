### Buses and Expansion Slots
Conventional PCI slots and Buses are slower than those of PCIe
- The PCI bus transmits 32 bits in parallel and operates at about 500 Mbps
- used for all types of add-on cards
*Onboard ports* (integrated components) are ports coming directly off the motherboard
- They may include USB, PS/2 mouse, keyboard, video, sound, network, and eSATA ports
- An *I/O shield* is a plate installed in computer case providing holes for I/O ports
A motherboard may have several internal connectors including USB, M.2 SATA, and PCIe connectors
*SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment or Serial ATA)* is an interface standard used mostly by storage devices
- Current versions of SATA include SATA express (SATAe), SATA3.x, and SATA2.x
*SAS (Serial Attached SCSI)* is an interface standard used mostly by storage devices and is the successor or SCSI
*M.2* is formerly known as the Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF)
- uses the PCIe, USB, or SATA interface to connect a mini add on card
A motherboard may have *USB* headers used to connect a cable from a motherboard to USB ports on the front of the computer case

### Using BIOS/UEFI setup to configure a Motherboard
Firmware on the motherboard is used to do the following
- Enable or disable a connector, port, or component
- Control the frequency and other features of the CPU
- Manage security features
- Control what happens when the computer first boots
- monitor and log various activities of the board
Motherboards made after 2012 use BIOS/UEFI firmware
*UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)* improves on BIOS but includes BIOS for backward compatibility with older devices
Facts about UEFI you should know
- Microsoft UEFI in order for a system to be certified for Windows 10/8
- UEFI is required for hard drives larger than 2TB
- UEFI offers *Secure boot* which prevents a system from booting put with drivers or and OD that is not digitally signed and trusted by the motherboard or computer manufacturer
- For backwards compatibility, UEFI can boot from a MBR device and provide a BIOS boot through it's *Compatibility Support Module (CSM)* feature
### Changing Boot options
Secure Boot
- Secure boot was invented to help prevent malware from launching before the OS and anti-malware software are launched
- Secure boot works only when the boot mode is UEFI (and note CSM) and the OS supports it
- It is supported by Windows 10 and several distributions on Linux
- Secure boot holds digital signatures, encryption keys, and drivers in databases stored in flash memory on the motherboard and/or the hard drive
- When enabled, it checks each driver, the OS, and applications before UEFI launches these programs to verify it is signed and identified in the secure boot databases
- *Never let users in BIOS*
### Configuring Onboard Devices
You can enable or disable some onboad devices using BIOS/UEFI setup
- For example - network ports, USB ports, or video ports
What you can configure depends on the onboard devices the motherboard offers
One possible setting you can change is *USB power share* which enables you to change a USB device even when the PC is turned off
*Overclocking* is running a processor, memory, motherboard, or video card at a higher speed than the manufacturer recommends
- Some motherboards and processors allow overclocking, but it is not a recommended best practice
### Configuring Security Features
Drive password protection
- Some motherboards allow you to set a password in order to access the hard drive
- Does  not encrypt all the data on the drive but only a few organizational sectors
### BIOS support for virtualization
*Virtualization* is when one physical computer uses software to create multiple virtual computers
- A *virtual machine (VM)* simulates the hardware of a physical computer as a virtual motherboard and virtual hard drive
- Virtualization must be enabled in BIOS/UEFI setup
### Exiting the BIOS/UEFI Setup Menus
When you finish with BIOS/UEFI setup, an Exit screen gives you various options such as
- Saving you changes and exiting
- Discarding your changes and exiting
Some offer the option to load optimized defaults
- This option sometimes solve a problem when a user has made several inappropriate changes to the BIOS/UEFI settings or you are attempting to recover an error created while updating the firmware
### Updating the Motherboard Drivers and BIOS/UEFI
When a motherboard is causing problems or you want to use a new OS or hardware device, you might need to update the motherboard drivers or update the BIOS/UEFI firmware
Both skills are covered next
Motherboard drivers aren't the issue, it's BIOS/UEFI updates
#### Installing or Updating Motherboard Drivers
*Device drivers* are small programs that an OS uses to communicate with specific hardware
The CD or DVD that comes with the motherboard contains a user guide and drivers for it's onboard components
After installing a motherboard, you can install the drivers from CD or DVD and later update them by downloading updates from the motherboard manufacturer's website
- Sometimes updates are included in updates to windows
Be sure to get the correct drivers for the OS edition and type (example: Windows 10 64-bit) you are using with the board
### Updating Firmware
The process of upgrading or refreshing the programming and data stored on the firmware chip is called updating firmware, *flashing BIOS/UEFI* or *flashing BIOS*
To flash BIOS/UEFI, always follow the directions found in the user guide for you motherboard
Motherboards can use one or more of these methods
- Download and update from within BIOS/UEFI setup
- Update from a USB flash drive using BIOS/UEFI setup
- Run an express BIOS/UEFI update
### Using jumpers to clear BIOS/UEFI settings
A *Jumper* is two small posts or metal pins that stick up from the motherboard that is used to hold configuration information
- An open jumper has no cover and a closed jumper has a cover on the two pins
If flashing BIOS/UEFI fails, a jumper can be set up to undo the update
To learn how to set up jumpers, see the motherboard documentation
### Installing or Replacing a Motherboard
A motherboard is considered a Field replaceable unit
A technician needs to know how to select an appropriate motherboard and how to install or replace one in a desktop or laptop computer
### How to select a Desktop Motherboard
Three approaches
- Select the board that provides the most room for expansion
- Select the board that best suits the needs of the computer's current configuration
- Select a motherboard that meets your present needs with moderate room for expansion
Some questions to ask yourself when selecting motherboard include
- How is the motherboard to be used
- What form factor is the motherboard
- Which brand (Intel or AMD) and model processors does the board support
- - Which type and speed of memory does the board support
- Does the board fit the case you plan to use
- What are the price and the warranty on the board? Does the board get good reviews?
- How extensive and user friendly is the documentation and how helpful is the manufacturer's website
- What warranty and how much support does the manufacturer supply for the board?
### How to Replace a motherboard
1. Verify the right motherboard is selected
2. Get familiar with documentation, features, settings
3. Remove components to reach the old motherboard
4. Install the I/O shield
5. Install the motherboard
6. Install the processor and processor cooler
7. Install RAM into the appropriate slots on the motherboard
8. Attach the wires and cabling (case switches, power supply, drives)
9. Install the video card
10. plug the computer into a power source
11. Boot the system and enter BIOS/UEFI setup
12. Observer POST and verify no errors occur
13. Verify that windows starts with no errors
14. Install the motherboard drivers
15. Install any other expansion cards and drivers
16. Verify that the system is operating properly, make final OS and BIOS/UEFI adjustments
### Summary
You should be able to
- Describe and contrast various types and features of motherboards
- Configure a motherboard by updating drivers and firmware, using jumpers to clear BIOS/UEFI settings and replacing the CMOS battery
- Select, install, and replace a desktop motherboard
