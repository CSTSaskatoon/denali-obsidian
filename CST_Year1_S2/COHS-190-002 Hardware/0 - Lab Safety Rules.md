1. *No food or drink allowed in the labs.*
2. *No running, pushing, shoving, etc.* Tools and parts must be handled carefully, *never thrown or slid across the work area.* (Common sense!)
3. *Anti-static wristbands must be worn at all times* by anyone working inside a computer or handling any components outside of an anti-static bag. The straps must be grounded when used. You can use the snaps or grounding posts provided at the stations.
4. *All components removed from a computer must be kept inside anti-static bags.* Place the components in a bag immediately upon removal, and do not remove them from the bag until they are ready to be installed.
5. *Hold all cards and boards by the edges.* Do not touch any of the metal or soldered components if you can avoid it.
6. *Computers must be unplugged, not just turned off*, before working on them. Using the power switch does not guarantee that there isnâ€™t power going to system components.
7. *Power off computers before moving them*. Moving or jarring computers when powered on may damage the hard drive.
8. *Take care when removing or inserting components*. Sometimes a fair bit of force is needed to remove or seat the components properly, so slips are not uncommon. Some of the computer parts, especially the case itself, may have metal or plastic parts with edges sharp enough to cut your hand.
9. Use safe lifting practices when lifting the computers, monitors and other heavy equipment. *Lift with your legs, not your back*. Use two hands and be sure you have a good grip.
10. *Unplug the computer if it starts to make any unusual noises, smells, or begins to smoke*. Contact an instructor immediately.
11. **Consult an instructor before making any changes to BIOS or system settings, jumpers, etc. that are not part of an assignment or lab activity.**
