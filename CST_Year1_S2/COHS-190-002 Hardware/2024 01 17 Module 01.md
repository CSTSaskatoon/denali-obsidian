### Putting a computer back together
1. Refer to any diagrams created during the disassembling process
2. Install components in this order: power supply, drives, motherboard and cards (*This order varies, do it in the reverse of how you took it apart*)
- When installing drives, it may be easier to connect cables to the drives before sliding them into the bay
3. Place the motherboard inside the case
- make sure ports and screw holes are lined up
4. Connect the power cords from the power supply to the the motherboard
5. Connect wire leads from the front panel of the case to the front panel header on the motherboard
- To help orient the larger connectors, look for a small triangle embedded on the connector that makes one of the outside wires as pin 1
	- Line up ping 1 on connector with pin 1 marked on the motherboard
6. Connect wires to the front panel ports of the case (*Front audio, USB headers*)
7. Install the video card and other expansion cards
8. Double check each connection
9. Plug in Keyboard and Mouse
10. In a classroom environment, have the instructor check your work
11. Turn on the power and check the PC is working properly
- If not, most likely a loose connection or memory not seated properly

# Laptops
### First Look at Laptop Computers
A *laptop (notebook)* is designed for portability and can be just as powerful as a desktop
Varieties of laptops include
- Touch screen
- Some have a rotating or removable screen
- A *Netbook* is smaller and less expensive with with fewer features
- *All-in-one computer* has the monitor and computer case built together and uses components common to a laptop and a desktop
Ports common to laptops include USB, network, and audio ports
When a laptop is missing a port or slot, you can use a USB dongle
### Docking stations and Port Replicators
Some laptops have a connector called a docking port that connects to a docking station
A *Docking station* provides ports to allow a laptop to easily connect to a full-sized monitor, keyboard, AC power adapter, and other peripheral devices
A *Port Replicator* (universal docking station) is a device that provides ports to allow a laptop to easily connect to peripheral devices
To use a docking station or port replicator plug all peripherals into the docking station or port replicator, then connect the laptop to the station
### Special Considerations when not supporting laptops
Laptops and their replacement parts cost more than desktop PCs
Factors to consider that apply more to laptops than to desktops
- The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) warranty
- The service manuals and diagnostic software provided by the manufacturer
- The customized installation of the OS that is unique to laptops
- The need to order replacement parts directly from the laptop manufacturer or authorized source
Warranty Concerns
- Always check to see if the laptop is under warranty before servicing
- When contacting technical support have the following
	- laptop model and serial number, purchaser name, phone number, address
Service manual and other sources of Information
- Service manuals save time
	- They enable safe laptop disassembly
Most laptop manufacturers provide diagnostic software that can help you test components to determine which component needs replacing
- Manufacturer's website, CDs bundled with the notebook, or on hard drive
### Working inside a laptop
It may become necessary to open a laptop case to upgrade memory, exchange a hard drive, or replace a failed component
Screws and nuts on a laptop are smaller than a desktop, requiring smaller tools
Working on laptops requires extra patience
Always wear an ESD strap
Tape screws on a piece of paper or beside the manufacturer documentation
- Work methodically to keep screws and components organized
Tips
- Find the hardware service manual
- Opening the case might void the warranty
- Take your time and do not force anything
- Pry plastic covers with dental pick or screwdriver
- Plastic screws may be used only once
- Disassemble components in order
- Use a plastic pry tool
### Exploring laptop Internal Components
List of laptop components and the typical order you remove them
1. Remove or disable Battery pack
2. Remove hard drive
3. Remove memory
4. Remove the wireless card
5. Remove optical drive
6. Crack the case
7. Remove keyboard bezel
### Maintaining Laptops
A few general guidelines to follow when maintaining laptops
- Do not touch the LCD panel with sharp objects
- Do no pick up or hold a laptop by the lid
- Use only battery packs recommended by the manufacturer
- Do not tightly pack the laptop in a suitcase
- Do not move while hard drive is being accessed
- Do not put close to appliances generating strong electromagnetic field
