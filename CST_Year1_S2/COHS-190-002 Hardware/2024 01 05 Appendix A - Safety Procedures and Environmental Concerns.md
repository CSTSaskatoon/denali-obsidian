Hardware is just a tool for you to use
### Stay safe and keep others safe
Electrical Equipment damaged physically, exposed to water, moisture, or electrical shorts
- unplug immediately
Other Dangers
- Chemical burns
- Cables that can cause people to trip
- Heavy equipment that can hurt a technician's back
- Sharp edges in and around case
### Protecting yourself and equipment against electrical dangers
Important to understand electricity and how to protect yourself and equipment against it
Must learn to prevent getting shocked or damaging a component
### Measures and Properties of Electricity
Alternating Current (AC) oscillates between negative and positive voltage
- House current is AC and oscillates 60 Hz
Direct Current (DC) travels in one direction
- Type of current used by most electronic devices
Rectifier - A device that converts AC to DC
Inverter - A device that converts DC to AC
Transformer - Changes the ratio of voltage to current
#### Voltage/Current

_^ A transformer keeps power constant but changes the ratio of current to voltage_
#### AC pathing and Neutral/Grounded lines

AC travels on a _hot line_ from a power station
AC returns to the power station on a _neutral line_ 
When AC follows an unintended path (one with less resistance) a *short* can occur
- _short_ - A sudden increase in flow that can create a sudden increase in temperature
The neutral line is grounded to prevent uncontrolled electricity in a short
- _Grounding_ - the line is connected directly to the earth, so that electricity can flow into the earth
#### Plugs

### Protect Yourself against Electrical shock and burns
When working with any electrical device, disconnect power if you notice a dangerous situation that might lead to electrical shock or fire
Potential dangers include
- Power cord is frayed or damaged
- Water or other liquid is spilled near
- Device has been dropped or physically damaged
- Smell a strong electronics odor - Burning plastic or musty burn smell
- Power supply or fans make a whining noise - if a fan is off replace it, it will just consume power and output heat
- Smoke is observed or case feels unusually warm
When working on sensitive low-voltage equipment such as a motherboard or processor
- Ground yourself with an anti-static grounding bracelet connected to the ground
When working with power supplies, printers and CRT monitors that contain capacitors
- Do not ground yourself because power can flow through you to the ground
- Power supplies and monitors are considered a _field replaceable unit (FRU)_, which means you are expected to how to replace, not know how to repair it
Never use water to put out a fire (water is a conductor)
Use a fire extinguisher that is rated to put out electrical fires
Fire extinguisher ratings
- Class A - can use water to put out fires caused by wood, paper, or other combustibles
- Class B - can put out fires caused by liquids such as gasoline, kerosene, and oil
- Class C - uses non-conductive chemicals to put out a fire caused by electricity
- Ex. 1-A:10-B:C is a fire extinguisher capable of extinguishing all 3 classees.
### Proper use of Cleaning pads and Solutions
Most cleaning solutions contain flammable and poisonous materials
- take care when using them
- A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) explains how to properly handle these
### Managing Cables
Make sure cables are in a safe place
- People can trip over cables left on floor (trip hazard)
If cable must be ran across a path where someone sits use a cable or cord cover
