# All about Motherboards
By the end of this module you should be able to
- Describe and contrast various types and features of motherboards
- Configure a motherboard using BIOS/UEFI firmware
- Maintain a motherboard by updating drivers and firmware, using jumpers to clear BIOS/UEFI settings and replacing the CMOS battery
- Select, install, and replace a desktop motherboard
### Motherboard form factors
The motherboard form factor determines the motherboard size and features that make it compatible with power supplies and cases
The most popular are *ATX, microATX, Extended ATX (E-ATX) and Mini-ITX*

### Intel and AMD processor Sockets
A *chipset* is a set of chips on the motherboard that works closely with the processor to control the memory, buses on the motherboard, and some peripherals
- must be compatible with the processor it serves
A *socket* is rectangular with pins or pads to connect the processor to the motherboard
The two major chipset and processor manufacturers are Intel and AMD
Currently AMD has four chipset and socket categories
sTRX4 socket which uses the TRX 40 chipset
TR4 socket which uses the AMD X399 chipset
AM4 socket and chipset are used with AMD Ryzen and Athlon processors
AM3+ socket and chipset are used with AMD Piledriver and Bulldozer processor
To match a processor to a motherboard and socket
- Look at the motherboard manufacturer's website or user guide for a list of processors the motherboard supports
- You can also search for Intel or AMD website for the exact processor to make sure the socket it uses is the same as the socket on the motherboard
### Buses and Expansion Slots
Fine lines found on both the top and bottom of a motherboard are sometimes called *traces*
- Traces are circuits or paths that enable data, instructions, timing signals, and power to move from component to component on the board
A *bus* is a system of pathways used for communication and the protocol and methods used for transmission
- A *protocol* is a set of rules and standards that any two entities use for communication
