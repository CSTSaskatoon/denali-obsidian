# IO and Peripherals
### Capture cards
Used to record and stream content form an external device such as a gaming console or webcam
Some capture cards use a PCIe port on the motherboard
Another type of capture card is a peripheral device that connects to the computer using a USB, USB-C, or Thunderbolt port
Some capture cards offer ports for input from a microphone and output to a headset
After installing a capture card, you can download and use proprietary software that comes with the card, or you can use third-party software
### Video subsystems
A monitor is the primary output device of a monitor
2 necessary components for video output are the monitor and the video card (also called video adapter or graphics cards) or a video port on motherboard
#### Monitors
*Liquid Crystal Display* (LCD) monitor
- Also called flat-panel
- first used in laptops
- At the center of layers is liquid crystal material
- Layers are sandwiched between 2 grids of electrodes forming columns and rows and each intersection forms a pixel

*Organic Light-emitting Diode* (OLED)
- uses a thin LED film between 2 grids of electrodes and does not use backlighting
- A digital projector shines a light that projects a transparent image onto a large screen
##### Changing Monitor Settings
Settings that apply to the monitor can be managed by using the monitor buttons, function keys on a keyboard, and windows utilities
Using monitor buttons, you can
- Adjust horizontal and vertical position
- Change the brightness and contrast settings

On laptops, function keys are usually used instead of buttons
Windows utilities can also be used to change monitor settings
### Troubleshooting I/O devices
Try non-invasive and least expensive solutions first
Try the obvious
