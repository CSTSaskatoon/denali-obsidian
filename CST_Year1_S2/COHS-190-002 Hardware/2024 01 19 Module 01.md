### Units and Formulas
*Ohm's Law*
- *V = I R*
Voltage, EMF or potential difference V
- (volt) or (V)
Current I
- (amp) or (A)
- rate of change
Resistance R
- (ohm) or (Ω)
Power
- P = I V = (I^2)R = (V^2)/R
- P = E/t
- (watt) = (W)
- Energy E (joules) = (j)
#### Definition of Current
= q/t
#### Definition of Resistance
*R = pL/A*
Resistivity p(Ωm)
Length L(m)
Area A(M^2)
*Pf = Pi(1+a(ΔT))*
Wire gets smaller, cross sectional area goes down, resistivity goes up and more resistance driving more heat can also create resistivity
### Multimeters
Digital and analog
Measure voltage, current, resistance, or continuity
Select AC or DC
Select the range of values being careful not to overload the meter
### Power Supply Measurement
Possible to measure AT, ATX, BTX power supply connector, molex connector
Get documentation on pinout for the computer you are working on
Common points to most pinouts
- Positive and negative voltage
- Common ground
- Power good
- Power supply on
### Caution
Don't cross leads as a short can cause damages to the leads and computer
Don't have leads come in contact with components
Grounding leads and touching a hot connector hurts
