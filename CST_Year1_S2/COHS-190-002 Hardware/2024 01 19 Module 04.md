# Power Supplies and Troubleshooting Computer Problems
##### Objectives
Describe the methods and devices to keep a system cool
Select a power supply to meet the power of the system
Demonstrate an organized approach to solving any computer problem, especially hardware problems occurring during the boot
Troubleshoot problems with electrical systems
### Cooling Methods and Devices
If the processor, motherboard, memory modules, expansion cards, and other components overheat, the system can get unstable and components can fail or be damaged
Devices used to cool a system are CPU and case fans, heat sinks, and liquid cooling systems
General rules to cool the inside of a computer case include the following
- Keep the case closed
- Clean the inside of the computer
- Move the computer
### Processor Coolers, Fans, and Heat Sinks
Computer systems use a cooling assembly designed for a specific processor to keep temperatures below the max temp
Good processor coolers maintain a temperature of 90-110 degrees F
The cooler sits on top of the processor and consists of a fan and a heatsink
- Heat sink uses fins that draw heat away from the processor
The fan blows drawn heat away from the CPU
- The fan gets power by using a 4-pin header on the motherboard
### Thermal Compound and Thermal pads
Thermal compound (thermal paste) transfers heat by completely filling the gap between the processor and the cooling device
An alternative is a thermal pad, which is thicker than thermal compound and fills larger gaps better
- More easily applied and are sized for the contact plate
Don't stack thermal pads
Don't use thermal paste and thermal pads at the same time
### Case Fans, Other Fans, and Heat Sinks
To prevent overheating, you can also install additional case fans
Most cases have one or more positions on the case to hold a case fan
- Large fans tend to perform better
Some GPUs come with a fan
- Fan cards can be mounted next to GPUs
- Be sure to select a fan card that fits your expansion slot
A RAM cooler clips over a DIMM memory module
- May be powered by a SATA or 4-pin molex power connector
