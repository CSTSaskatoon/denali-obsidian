# More safety Stuff
### Managing Cables
Make sure cables are in a safe place
- people can trip over cables left on floor (called a *trip hazard*)
If cable must be ran across a path or where somewhere sits
- use a cable or cord server
### Lifting Heavy Objects
Avoid back injury
- decide which side of object to face so that the load is most balanced
- Stand close to the object with feet apart
- Keep back straight, ben knees and grip load
- Lift with legs, arms, and shoulders (not with back or stomach)
- Keep the load close to your body an avoid twisting your body while holding it
- To put object down, keep back straight and lower object by bending knees
### Protect the Equipment Against Static Electricity or ESD
 *Electrostatic discharge (ESD)* - electrical charge at rest
 - When 2 objects with dissimilar electrical charges touch, electricity passes between them until charges are equal
ESD can cause 2 types of damage
- *Catastrophic* - destroys the component
- *Upset* - Damages the component so that it doesn't work well
- Both types permanently affect the device
To protect against ESD always ground yourself
- Ground bracelet (ESD Strap), attach bracelet to PC to ground it (alligator clip an the computer case)
- Ground Mats (ESD Mats)
- Static shielding bags
- Antistatic gloves
#### Rules for protecting against ESD
1. When passing a board or other component, ground yourself first
2. Leave components inside antistatic bags until ready to use them
3. Don't work on carpet
4. Don't work on a computer in a cold and dry atmosphere
5. Remove packing tape and cellophane from around work area (materials that attract ESD)
6. Keep components away from hair and clothing
### Protecting the computer and the environment
Avoid future problems by protecting your PC against environmental factors (Humidity, dust, out of control electricity)
Technicians must learn how to properly dispose of used computer equipment
### Physically Protect your PC
Does and Don'ts
- Do not more or jar computer when on
- protect computer against dust and other airborne particles
- Allow for good ventilation inside and outside the system
- High temperatures and humidity can be dangerous
- Use BIOS setup to disable ability to write to HDD boot sector
- Protect your CDs, DVDs, BDs, and other storage media
- Don't leave your PC turned off for weeks or months at a time
- Don't unpack and turn on a cold PC
- Protect electrical equipment from power surges
	- Use uninterruptable power supply (UPS) to protect against power shortages, brownouts and sags
### Surge Protection and Battery Backup
Storms and uneven AC flow cause power surges
Prevent power surges by installing and AC filter
Types of devices used to manage power surges
- Surge suppressor
- Power conditioners
- UPSs
Use devices with UL (Underwriters library) logo
#### Surge Suppressors
Also called surge protector
Protects equipment from sudden surges in power
Recommended features
- Joules rating that is greater than 600 joules
- Other shit
#### Power Conditioners
Sometimes called line conditioners
functions
- Protects against spikes or swells (voltages surges)
- Raise voltage during brownouts (voltage sags)
Load supported measured in watts or voltage-amps (VA)
Determining the VA needed to support for your system
- multiply the amperage of each component by 120V
- add up the VA for each component
#### Uninterruptable Power Supplies
UPS offers 3 benefits
- conditions line to account for brownouts and spikes
- Limited power backup for blackouts
- Protection against high spikes
Designs - Standby, inline, and line-interactive
Smart (intelligent) UPS - controlled software
What to consider when buying a UPS
- UPS rating should exceed VA load by at least 25%
- Degree of line conditioning
- Warrantees, guarantees, and service policies
### Document Preventative Maintenance
Keep a record book for each new computer
- record any changes in setup data and any problems or maintenance
- Keep a record of all changes to BIOS setup data and jumpers on the motherboard
Label documentation and keep in a safe place
### How to dispose of Used Equipment
First check to see if any equipment can be donated or at least recycled
If a computer is given away
- Uninstall and application software
- Delete private data (use a zero-fill utility)
If trashing a computer
- Use a degausser to erase everything on a magnetic hard drive or drill holes through the drive (drilling holes is not the best)
- Comply with local government regulation when disposing of any type of equipment
