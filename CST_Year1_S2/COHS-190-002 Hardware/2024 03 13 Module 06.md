### Hardware RAID
Software RAID is bad
Motherboard needs to support RAID
managed in BIOS/UEFI or a RAID controller card
for best performance, all drives in the array should be identical in brand, size, speed and other features
If windows is to be installed on a RAID hard drive RAID must be implemented before windows is installed (Get the RAID working before installing windows)
#### Implementing the hardware RAID
for a RAID 5 array, use 3 matching SATA drives
- Install drives into the case and connect them to the motherboard
- Boot the system and enter BIOS/UEFI setup to verify the drives are recognized
- Select the option to configure SATA and select RAID
- When the system reboots, enter BIOS/UEFI, on the advanced page, select *Intel Rapid Storage Technology*, and then select *Create RAID Volume*
- Under RAID level, select RAID 5 (parity) and Strip Size value
- Enter the size of the volume
- Select *Create Volume* to complete the configuration
### Troubleshooting Hard Drives
Problems on hard drives
- Hard drive subsystem
- File system on drive
- Files required by Windows when it begins to load

Need to know if the problem is software or hardware
#### Slow Performance
One of the most common issues with hard drives
Overall performance of the system depends on individual performance(processor, motherboard, memory, hard drive)
To optimize a drive, you can use windows tools or tools provided by the hard drive manufacturer
To diagnose hard drive performance, use a hard drive speed test utility program such as `DISKSPD`
Can also use the Windows Defrag and Optimization tool (`dfrgui.exe`)
### Migrating data to a new SSD in a laptop
Install the cloning software on your laptop
Attach the SATA-to-USB data transfer cable to a USB port on your laptop
Attach the new SSD to the SATA-to-USB data transfer cable
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete data migration
Remove the old drive, and install the SSD into the laptop
Install the drive management software from the manufacturer
### Hard drive problems during boot
Hardware problems usually show up at POST
If BIOS/UEFI can't access the drive it might be the drive, cable, electrical system, motherboard or a loose connection
Things to check before opening the case
- Check to see if BIOS/UEFI displays a numeric display error code or other message during POST
- Check BIOS/UEFI setup for errors in the hard drive config
- Try booting from another bootable media
- If using RAID, use firmware utility to check the status of the disks

If it's still not solved
- Remove and reattach all drive cables
- If using a RAID or SATA controller card, remove and reseat it or place it in a different slot
- Inspect the drive for damage
- Determine if hard drive is spinning by listening
- Check the cable for frayed edges
- Check the installation manual
- SMART errors mean data should be backed up and drive replaced as soon as possible
### File systems used by storage devices
A *file system* is the overall structure the OS uses to name, store, and organize files on a drive
- Each storage device is assigned a drive letter (called a volume)

Using windows to install a new filesystem on a device or logical drive is called *formatting*
File system formats
- NTFS
- exFAT
- FAT32 and FAT
- Compact Disc File System (CDFS) or Universal Disk Format (UDF)
### Optical Disks/Drives
Compact Disks (CDs), Digital Versatile Discs/Digital video discs (DVD), and Blu-ray discs(BD) use similar laser technologies
- Tiny lands and pits on surface represent bits read by a laser beam

Optical Discs
- Data is written to only one side of the CD
- DVD/BD can hold data in 2 layers on each side

Optical Drives and Burners
- BD are backwards compatible with DVD and CD technologies
- DVD drives are backwards compatible with CD
- Depending on drive features, an optical drive might be able to read/write to CD, DVD, and BD
- A disk that can write to discs is called a burner
- Today's internal optical drives interface with the motherboard via SATA
