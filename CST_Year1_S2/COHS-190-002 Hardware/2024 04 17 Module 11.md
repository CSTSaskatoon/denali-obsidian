# Types of Documents and Support Systems
A *Knowledge base* is a collection of articles containing text, images, or video that gives information about a network, product, or service
*Asset Management* tracks physical and digital assets, including end-user devices, network devices, IP addresses, software licenses, and related licenses
- might track equipment usage using *asset tags* and theft-prevention plates that contain *barcodes* that are easily ready by laser scanners

Password policy
Network documentation should contain a network topology diagram (*diagram* refers to the pattern which devices on a network are connected to each other)
### Ticketing Systems
One of the first systems you'll learn to use in IT is tracking is a ticketing system used to track support calls and give technicians a place to keep their call notes
An initial call for help starts the process by creating a *ticket* which is a record of the request and what is happening to resolve it
- Ticket stays open until the issue is resolved
- Support staff assigned to the ticked documentation process in the call tracking system
- As an open ticket ages, more attention/resources are assigned to it (escalated)
# Change Management
When a project is implemented, change happens
*Change management* is closely integrated with project management and often involves the same teams
A change manager might work with the same team to define how the software will affect people
A change manager may also manage all communication, scheduling, training, and support required so the affected people accept and embrace the end result

*Documented business processes* are related activities that lead to a desired business goal such as
- An efficient and cost-effective service
- Excellent customer satisfaction
- A superior product

Purpose of change
- A proposed change is formally submitted using a change *request form* that states what needs to be changed
- Complex changes are often submitted to a *change advisory board (CAB)*
### Scope and Risk Analysis
The change plan defines the *scope of change*, which may outline the following
- Key components of the change and how they will be addressed
- Skill sets, tasks, and activities required to carry out the change
- Individuals or departments that will participate in the change
- How the success of change is measured and when the change is completed

Risk Analysis
- Change almost always involves risk
- *Risk analysis* is the process of identifying potential problems so there are no surprises or crisis situations once the change begins
### Rollback Plan
Defines the activities needed to recover the original state in the event of an aborted or failed change implementation
To gain end-user acceptance to change, users must know
- Purpose of the change
- That the leadership of the company agrees with the change
- How the change will affect them and their job
- How to get their individual concerns and questions answered
- That they will receive end-user training for the changes that impact them

*Request for comments (RFC)* is a request for user feedback to a change
### Document Changes
Everything related to changes must be documented
Change plans are documented and updated throughout the entire change management process
Many large organization use change management software, such as ChangeGear to manage all stages of change management
Smaller organization may manually document change using Microsoft Word or Excel documents or database software
# Working in Diverse Software Environments
### Operating Systems
An *operating system (os)* is software that controls a computer
All OSs share the following 4 functions
- Provide user interface
- Manage files
- Manage hardware
- Manage applications

Every OS offers a command-driven interface and almost every OS offers one or more *GUI*
Some servers such as Linux Ubuntu server don't always require a graphical user interface
#### Popular Operating Systems
The four most popular OSs for workstations are Windows, macOS, Linux and Chrome OS
Windows by Microsoft is the most popular workstation OS
macOS by Apple is extremely easy to use, and its desktop interface is intuitive and "beautiful"
Linux is secure and extremely stable that doesn't take up much space on the hard drive
Chrome OS by Google is a relatively simple OS that works on personal devices including tablets, and laptops called Chromebooks
#### How an OS manages Hardware
The OS kernel is the part of the OS that is responsible for relating to hardware by the way of device drivers and/or firmware on the hardware
Device drivers are small programs stored on the hard drive that tell the OS how to communicate with a specific hardware device
- These drivers are installed when the OS is first installed or when new hardware is added

Firmware is stored on microchips on the motherboard and interfaces between the motherboard and the OS
All modern motherboards use UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
- UEFI is a much improved replacement for BIOS (basic input/output system)

The motherboard BIOS/UEFI provides three functions:
- System BIOS/UEFI contains instructions for running hardware devices before an OS is started 
- Startup BIOS/UEFI starts the computer and finds a boot device that contains an OS
- Setup BIOS/UEFI is used to change motherboard settings 
	- You can use it to enable or disable a device on the motherboard, change data and time, or select the order of boot devices for startup BIOS to search


##### OS managing Hard drives
Low-level formatting is a process (usually performed at the factory) that organizes the space in a long series of logical blocks; this is called Logical Block Addressing (LBA)
The drive is further organized into one or more partitions using one of two partitioning systems:
- MBR partitions keep a map of partitions in a partition table stored at the beginning of the hard drive called the MBR 
	- Can have up to three primary partitions (also called volumes) 
	- A fourth partition (called extended partition) can hold one or more volumes called logical drives

- GPT partitions the newer Globally Unique Identifier Partition Table (GUID or GPT)
#### How a File System Works
A file system is the overall structure an OS uses to name, store, and organize files and folders on any storage device 
For Windows, a hard drive partition is assigned a drive letter (C:) and is called a volume
Installing a file system on a volume is called formatting the drive or high-level formatting
Every OS manages a storage device by using directories (also called folders), subdirectories, and files
The drive or volume is organized with a single root directory a the top of the hierarchical structure of subdirectories

The drive and directories that point to the location of a file are called the path to the file
The first part of the name is called the file name and the part after the period is called the file extension
The file extension indicates how the file is organized or formatted, the type of content in the file, and what program uses the file
##### File System Technologies
NTFS (New Technology File System)
FAT32
exFAT
ext3 (third extended file system) 
ext4 (fourth extended file system) 
APFS (Apple File System)
#### Type of OS Installations and Upgrades
If a hard drive is new, a clean install must be installed If an OS is already installed, you have three choices:
- A clean install overwrites the existing OS and applications
	- In the Windows setup program, a clean install is called a custom installation

- An upgrade installation that is launched from within the existing operating system
	- The upgrade carries forward user settings and installed applications

- Repair - each OS has various tools and commands you can use to repair a corrupted installation

To perform a clean install, upgrade, or some OS repairs, youâ€™ll need the installation files provided by the OS manufacturer
For a new or corrupted hard drive, the storage device holding the installation files must be bootable, which means it can be accessed by BIOS/UEFI to launch an operating system
After the OS is running, it then launches the setup program to install the new OS
### Vendor End-of-Life Limitations and Product Life Cycle
Windows - starting with Windows 10, Microsoft extended the life of the OS by providing incremental feature updates
- Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 are no longer supported or updated by Microsoft 

macOS - the OS version a Mac can support depends on the age of the Mac
- Each version of macOS is supported with updates for about three years after its release

Linux - how long a Linux distribution is supported depends on the developer

Chrome OS - Google releases a complete Chrome OS update about every six weeks and minor updates are released about every 2-3 weeks
- For best results, keep automatic updates turned on
