# Troubleshooting IO Devices
Always best to try the least expensive/least invasive solutions first
### NumLock Indicator Light
When users complain that they can't sign into windows even entering the correct power ask them to make sure the NumLock key is set correctly
- Laptops use this key to toggle between the keys interpreted as numbers and letters

Most laptops have a NumLock indicator light near the keyboard
### Device Manager
Good place to start troubleshooting
Right click and click *properties* to see a device's properties
Updating device drivers
- Click *Update Driver* on general tab or driver tab
- If a driver update creates a problem, roll back (undo) the driver update if previous drivers were working

Try to uninstall the device and reinstall it by clicking *Uninstall* on the driver tab
Can also locate and download latest drivers from manufacturer
### Audio Issues
make sure volume is turned up
Check all audio cables, jacks, speakers, and headphone connections
Update audio drivers
### Video issues
For monitor problems, try the easy things
- Checking cable connections and checking contrast/brightness

Steps for dealing with a blurry screen
- Clean the screen with cleaning wipe/cloth
- Set resolution to native/recommended
- Check cable connections
#### Video Cards
If you hear a whining sound when you power up the system
- Caused by card not getting enough power (PSU might be inadequate)

If you only see a black screen
- Likely caused by onboard video port not being disabled in BIOS/UEFI

If you hear a series of beeps on Startup
- BIOS/UEFI can't detect video card (try reseating)

Error messages appear about video appear when windows starts
- May be a conflict with the onboard video port (disable port)
#### No Monitor Indicator Light
Is the power cable plugged in
Is the monitor turned on
Is the monitor cable plugged into the video port at the back of the PC
Try a different monitor and a different monitor cable
Confirm video input source is set correctly
Ensure monitor is set to correct voltage
Might be a conflict with video card and onboard video port
Verify video cable connection inside case
Check contrast/brightness/backlight adjustment
Test a monitor that you know is good on the computer you suspect is bad
#### Screen Goes black
If the keyboard is a green motherboard and is being used with an energy saver monitor, it can be configured to go into standby or sleep mode after a period of inactivity
- can help to prevent *burn-in*

Use the power options applet in control panel to configure sleep settings on a computer
#### Poor display
LCD monitor controls are usually located on front of the monitor
Monitor display settings can be used to adjust font size, screen resolution, brightness, color, and Clear Type text
Update video drivers
*Dead pixels* are pixels not working
*Dim Image* - laptops dim the LCD screen when the computer is running on battery
A poor display might be caused by inadequate video RAM
#### Can't connect to external monitor or projector
make sure the monitor/projector is getting power
Check the connection at both ends of the video cable
Is the monitor or projector turned on
Use the function keys on a laptop to toggle between the laptop display and the external monitor/projector
Try using a different video cable
Try using a different video connection
If the projector shuts of unexpectedly, it might have entered sleep mode due to inactivity
#### Video systems in a laptop
If the LCD panel shows a black screen but the power light is on
- Look for an LCD cutoff switch or button on the laptop
- try to use the video port on the laptop to connect to external laptop
- If the external monitor doesn't work, the problem is with the LCD panel assembly (Will need to replace invertor/LCD panel)

Flickering, Dim or otherwise poor video
- Verify Windows Display settings
- Adjust brightness
- Update the video drivers
- If the cursor drifts, try using a different port on the computer or replacing the batteries in the mouse
- A flickering screen can be cause by bad video drivers, a low refresh rate, a bad inverter, or loose connections inside the laptop
