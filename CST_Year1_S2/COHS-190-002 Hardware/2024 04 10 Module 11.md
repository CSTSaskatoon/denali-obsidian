### Plan for Good service
Prepare for on-site visits by reviewing information about the service call
Should be familiar with the problem, urgency of the situation, what computer hardware/software needs servicing
Arrive with a complete set of equipment needed
Greet the customer in a friendly manner and shake hands
If the site is a residence, you should not remain there when only a minor is present
Listen and ask questions
#### Interview the Customer
As you ask questions, take notes
Have the customer reproduce the problem and note each step taken and it's results
Use diplomacy and good manners when you work with a user to solve a problem
#### Set and Meet Customer Expectations
Important to create an expectations of certainty with customers
Establish a timeline with your customer for completion of project
Give the customer an opportunity to make decisions about repairs with guidance
#### Working with a Customer On Site
Avoid distractions and don't accept personal calls on your cell phone
Answer calls from work, but keep calls to a minimum
Here are a few guidelines to follow when working at a user's desk
- Be as unobtrusive as possible as you work
- Protect the customer's confidential materials
- Don't take over the mouse and keyboard without permission
- Ask permission to use the printer or other equipment
- Don't use the phone without permission
#### Working with a Customer on the Phone
Phone support requires more interaction with customers
Technicians must be able to visualize what the customer sees
Patience is required if dealing with a novice user
If your call is disconnected, call back immediately
Don't eat or drink while on the phone
If caller must be put on hold, tell them how long it will be before you get back to them
Speak clearly and slowly
Don't complain about your boss, coworkers, or your company
#### When the customer isn't Knowledgeable
Be specific with your instructions
Have the customer backup files before you ask them to do anything that might harm the files
Ask the customer what is displayed on the screen to help track keystrokes
Follow along on your own computer
Give the customer plenty of opportunity to ask questions
Compliment the customer whenever you can
If the customer can't' help you solve the problem without a lot of coaching, tactfully request that the caller have someone with more experience call you
#### When the Customer is overly confident
Compliment the customer's knowledge, experience, or insight
Slow the conversation down
Don't back off from using problem-solving skills
Be careful not to accuse the customer of making a mistake
Even though the customer might be using technical jargon, don't use jargon back to the customer
#### Customer Complaints
Be an active listener, and let customers know they are not being ignored
Give the customer a little time to vent, and apologize when you can
Don't be defensive
Know how your employer wants you to handle a situation where you were verbally abused
If the complaint is against you or your product, identify the underlying problem if you can
Sometimes simply making progress or reducing the problem to a manageable state reduces the customer's anxiety
#### When the problem is solved
When you think it's solved, let the customer decide when the service is finished
Complete these tasks before closing
- Reboot the computer
- Allow the customer enough time to be fully satisfied everything is working
- Review the service call with the customer
- Explain preventative maintenance to the customer
#### Know your limits
Every technician does not know how to solve every problem with a computer
- Sometimes a problem needs to be assigned to someone higher in the support chain

If that happens, follow through to make sure the customer and new support person have made contact
Learn to be a professional when working with the coworkers
Put business matters above personal matters
Keep negative comments to yourself
Know your limits and be willing to admit when you can't do something
### Documentation and Support Systems
IT departments rely on good documentation and support systems to keep up with all the information surrounding IT operations in the entire organization

A *Knowledge Base* is a collection of articles containing text, images, videos that give information about a network, product, or service
*Asset Management* tracks physical and digital assets, including end-user devices, network devices, IP addresses, software licenses, and related licenses
- Might track equipment using *asset tags* and theft-prevention plates that contain *barcodes* that are easily read by laser scanners

Password policy
Network documentation should contain a network topology diagram (*topology* refers to the pattern in which devices on a network are connected to each other)
