### Problems that Come and go
Symptoms that might indicate an intermittent problem with the electrical system after the boot
- The PC stops or hangs for no reason
- memory errors appear intermittently
- Data is written incorrectly to the hard drive or files are corrupted
- The keyboard stops working at odd times
- The motherboard fails or is damaged (flip board over and look for scorch marks)
- The PSU overheats and becomes hot to the touch
- The PSU fan whines and becomes very noisy or stops
How to eliminate the problem
- Maybe PSU is inadequate
- Maybe PSU is faulty
- PSU fan might not work
	- Don't use the computer is the PSU fan doesn't work
### Power Problems with the motherboard
A short might occur if some component on the motherboard makes improper contact with the chassis
For some cases, check for missing standoffs
Shake the case gently and listen for loose screws (Don't do this with a server)
### Overheating
Symptoms
- System hangs or freezes at odd times or after boot starts
- Windows BSOD occurs after boot
- Can't hear fan running or fan makes whining sound
- You can't feel air being pulled in or out of the case
If you suspect overheating, go into BIOS/UEFI setup and view the temperature monitors for the system
You can purchase a temperature sensor that will sound an alarm when the inside of the case is too hot
Things to do to solve overheating include
- If system hangs, go to BIOS/UEFI and fine CPU temperature
- Use compressed air, a blower, or anti-static vacuum to remove dust from the power supply and vents
- Check airflow inside the case to see if fans are running (may need to replace a fan)
- Install extra fans if case will hold them
- Install a chassis air guide that guides air to the processor
- To improve airflow, replace missing faceplates and expansion slot covers
- Place case so that there are a few inches of space on both sides and the top of the case
- Verify the cooler is connected properly to the processor
- Check UEFI/BIOS setup to see if the processor is being overclocked (can cause system to overheat)
- Have too many peripherals been installed? try to leave an empty slot between each card
- Flash BIOS/UEFI to update motherboard firmware

### Issues with laptop power systems
Laptops can be powered by and AC adapter or a battery pack
Today's batteries use *lithium Ion* technology
Most AC adapters are capable of *auto-switching* from 110V to 220V AC power
Some mobile users like to keep an extra battery on hand
If power is not getting to the system or battery indicator light is on
- Verify the AC adapter is plugged into a live circuit electrical outlet
- Check if the AC adapter's plug is secure in the outlet
- Check connections on both sides of AC adapter transformer
- Check the connection at the DC jack on the laptop
If the batter is not charging when AC adapter is plugged in, the problem might be with the battery or motherboard
### Troubleshooting the Motherboard, Processor, and RAM
1. If an error message appears, google it
2. Run antivirus software
3. A memory module might be failing, use the *Memory Diagnostic Tool* 
4. Check for potential hardware problems using Device manager
5. Check Event viewer logs for a record about a hardware or specific application problem
6. In Windows, download and install any windows updates or patches
7. If a problem began after a change or new install, uninstall device or application
8. Use the windows about window to find how much RAM is installed
9. Check BIOS/UEFI setup to ensure proper settings
10. Disable any quick booting features in BIOS/UEFI
11. Flash BIOS/UEFI to update motherboard firmware
12. Check the motherboard manufacturer's website for diagnostic software
13. Update all drivers of the motherboard components that aren't working
14. If an onboard port or device isn't working
	- Verify the problem is not with the device using the port
	- Go into BIOS/UEFI setup and verify the port is enabled
	- Check Device Manager and verify Windows recognizes device or port with no errors
	- Update motherboard drivers for this device or port from manufacturer's website
	- Use the loop-back plug to test the port
	- Disable the port in BIOS/UEFI setup and install an expansion card
15. Suspect the problem is a failing hard drive
16. Suspect the problem is caused by overheating
17. Verify the installed processor is supported by the motherboard
### Windows Startup Repair
Many continuous restart errors can be solved by performing a startup repair process
The *Startup Repair* utility restores many of the Windows files needed for a successful boot
Follow these steps to startup repair from the windows setup USB drive or DVVD
- If necessary, change the boot priority order in BIOS/UEFI setup to boot first from the optical drive or USB drive
- On the opening scree, select your language and click next. On the next screen, click *Repair your computer*. Next, choose *Troubleshoot*
	- On the advanced options screen, choose Startup Repair
### Knowledge Check
Someone asks you for help with a computer that hangs at odd times. You turn it on and work for 15 minutes, and then the computer freezes and powers down
1. Replace the surge protector
2. Replace the power supply
3. Wait for 30 minutes for the system to cool down and try again
4. Install an additional fan
Answer - 3
### Summary
Now that the lesson has ended, you should be able to 
Describe the methods and devices for keeping a system cool
Select a power supply to meet the power needs of a system
Demonstrate an organized approach to solving any computer problem, especially hardware problems occurring during boot
Troubleshoot problems with the electrical system
Troubleshoot problems with the motherboard, processor and RAM
