# Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory
### Types and characteristics of Processors
The processor is installed on a motherboard and determines system computing power
Two major processor manufacturers are Intel and AMD 
#### Features affecting processor performance and compatibility with motherboards include: 
- Processor speed 
- Lithography 
- Socket and chipset the processor can use 
- Multiprocessing abilities, multiprocessing, multithreading, multicore processing, and dual processors

### Alternate Processor Types (ARM)
ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) is a processor architecture designed to simplify the instruction set used for computing 
ARM processors are low cost, low power, and low heat processors used in mobile devices 
Companies that use ARM processors include Samsung, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Apple
*Low cost to manufacture, small size*
### Selecting and Installing a processor
A hardware technician is sometimes called on to do the following tasks
- Assemble a computer from parts 
- Exchange a faulty processor 
- Add a processor 
- Upgrade an existing processor

In each situation, it is necessary to know how to how to match a processor to the system 
- You also need to know how to install a processor on the motherboard
#### Selecting a processor to Match System Needs
First requirement is to select a processor that the motherboard is designed to support
Processor features to consider include the following
- Use the highest-performing processor the board supports 
- Understand the processor’s ability to multitask 
- Balance the performance and power of the CPU with that of the entire system 
- Read reviews of the processors you are considering and look for reviews that include comparison benchmarks of several processors 

When processors and coolers are boxed together, the cooler heat sink might have *thermal compound* already applied to the bottom
### Steps for installing a processor and cooler assembly
#### Installing the processor (Intel)
1. Use an ESD strap or antistatic gloves
2. When replacing a processor, power down the system, unplug the power cord, press the power button to drain the system of power, and open case
3. Remove the socket protective cover 
4. Push down on the socket lever and gently push away from socket to lift lever 
5. As you lift the lever, the socket load plate is raised
6. Remove protective cover from the processor 
7. Align processor so the two notches on the edge of the processor line up with the posts embedded on the socket
8. Ensure the processor is aligned correctly in socket
9. Push down on the lever and gently return it to its locked position
#### Installing a Processor (AMD)
1. Open the socket lever and remove protective cover
2. Orient the four empty pin positions on the bottom with the four filled hole positions in the socket and carefully place processor in the socket
3. Verify processor pins are sitting slightly into the holes
4. Press the lever down and gently into position
5. Apply thermal compound and install the cooler
6. Clip the clipping mechanism into place on one side of the cooler
7. Connect the fan power cord to the 4-pin CPU fan header on the motherboard
#### Installing the cooler
1. Understand how cooler posts work
2. Apply thermal compound if necessary (may be pre-applied)
3. Some heavy coolers provide a plate that fits underneath the motherboard
4. After the plate is installed, install the cooler on top of the processor
5. For lighter coolers with locking pins, verify locking pins are turned counter- clockwise as far as they will go
6. Connect the power cord from the cooler fan to the motherboard

Check BIOS/UEFI setup to verify the system recognized the processor
### Memory
Random access memory (RAM) temporarily holds data and instructions used by the CPU
Dynamic RAM (DRAM) loses its data rapidly, and the memory controller must refresh it several thousand times a second
#### Two major categories of memory modules include
- All current motherboards for desktops use *DIMM (dual inline memory module)*
- *SO-DIMM (small outline DIMM)* are used on laptops
#### DIMM and SO-DIMM
The “D” in DIMM stands for “dual” for the independent pins on both sides of the edge connector
*DDR (Double Data Rate)* DIMM runs twice as fast as earlier DIMMs when it was invented
DDR3 uses 240 pins and are not compatible with other DIMM types (use different notches)
DDR4 is faster and uses less power than DDR3 - Uses 288 pins and has a single notch in the edge connector
DDRS5 is faster and uses less power than DDR4 - Offers up to 64 Gb DRAM and uses 288 pins
#### Factors that change capacity and speed
Number of channels they use
How much RAM is on one DIMM
Speed Error-checking abilities
Buffering
#### Channel Types
*Single channel* DIMMs means the memory controller is accessed one DIMM at a time
*Dual channels* allow the memory controller to communicate with two DIMMs at the same time and doubles speed of memory access
*Triple channel* motherboards can access three DIMMs at once
*Quad channel* motherboards can access four DIMMs at the same time
##### DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5 DIMMs use dual channels
- DDR3 DIMMs can also use triple channels
- DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5 can use quad channels
#### Setting up DIMM and SO-DIMM
For dual, triple, or quad channels to work the motherboard and the DIMM must support the technology
- Motherboard manufacturers typically color-code DIMM slots to show you how to configure dual, triple, or quad channeling

Setting up dual channeling, know that the pair of DIMMs in a channel must be equally matched in size, speed, and features
- It is recommended to use same manufacturer

For a triple-channel installation, three DIMM slots populated with three matching DDR3 DIMMs
##### Quad Channelling
Expect a motherboard that uses quad channeling to have eight memory slots
- The eight DIMM slots support four channels; each channel has two slots
- The processor can address four slots or four channels at the same time

To know which of the eight slots to populate for optimum performance, see the motherboard user manual
#### Speed Ratings
DIMM speeds are measured in either MHz or PC rating
A PC rating is a measure of the total bandwidth of data moving between the module and the CPU
###### To calculate the PC rating for a DDR4 DIMM, multiply the speed by 8 bytes because a DIMM has an 8-byte or 64-bit data path 
- For example, a DDR4 DIMM that runs at 3,000 MHz has a bandwidth or transfer rate of 3,000 x 8 or 24,000 MB/second, which is expressed as a PC rating of PC4 24000
- A DDR4 PC rating is labeled PC4

*Timings you want to be low, throughput you want to be high*
#### Error Correcting Code (ECC)
Error checking technology called ECC (error-correcting code) is used for reliability
A DIMM that supports ECC will have an extra chip, the ECC chip
###### ECC compares bits written to the module to what is later read from the module
- It can detect and correct an error in a single bit of the byte
- If there are errors in 2 bits of a byte, ECC can detect the error but cannot correct it

With ECC the data path width is 72 bits, with the extra 8 bits used for error checking
#### Comparing Timings
Buffers and registers hold data and amplify a signal before data is written to the module
- They can increase memory performance in servers

Some DIMMs use buffers, some use registers, and some use neither
You might see registered memory written as *RDIMM*
##### CAS (column access strobe) Latency is a way of measuring access timing
- It refers to the number of clock cycles it takes to write or read a column or row of data off a memory module
- Memory module ads might give the CAS latency value within series of timing numbers
