# Hard Drives
2.5", 3.5" and 5.25" drives
### Solid-state drives (SSD)
No moving parts
Built using non-volatile memory, similar to USB drives
*NAND flash memory*
life span is based on the number of write operations to the drive, and it can be expressed as TBW (Terabytes written) or DWPD (Drive writes per day)
SSDs are more expensive than magnetic hard drives, but they are faster, more reliable, last longer, and use less power
Popular form factors of SSDs
- 2.5", M.2 card, mSATA, PCI Express SSD Expansion card
### Performance
*Throughput* - measure in Mb/s, amount of data that flows through a point the data over the one second
*IOPS (input/output operations per second* - measure the amount of read or write operations performed in one second
*Latency* - measure the time required to process a data request of transaction
### Logical Block Addressing and Capacity
Low-level formatting is when sector markings are written to the hard drive at the factory
- not the same as high level formatting performed by OS installation

Hard drive firmware, BIOS/UEFI and the OS use logical block addressing (LBA) to address all hard drive sectors
- size of each block + the total number of blocks to determine drive capacity
### SMART
*Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology* is used to predict when a drive is likely to fail
System BIOS/UEFI uses SMART to monitor drive performance, temp and other factors
For magnetic drives, it monitors disk spin-up time, distance between the head of the disk and other mechanical activities of the drive
If SMART suspects a drive failure is abut to happen, it displays a warning
Can be enabled and disabled in BIOS/UEFI setup
### Interfaces
#### integrated Drive Electronics (IDE)
Standards allowed for one or two IDE connectors on a motherboard, each using a 40-pin data cable
- Two types of IDE cables are the older cable with 40-pin connectors with 40 wires and a newer cable with the same 40-pin connector and 80 thinner wires
- Max recommended length is 18"
#### Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
Can support 7 or 15 SCSI compliant devices in a system
- SCSI expansion card (SCSI host adapter) used a PCIe slot and provided one external connector for an external SCSI device and one internal connector for internal SCSI devices
#### Serial Attached Technology Advanced (SATA)
Most modern drives use SATA
- uses a serial data path, a SATA data cable can accommodate a single SATA drive

The three SATA standards include SATA Revision 3.x, SATA Revision 2.x, and SATA Revision 1.x
Standards are used by all types of drives
- supports *hot-swapping/hot-plugging* - can connect and disconnect a drive while the system is running

a SATA drive connects to one internal SATA connector on the motherboard via a 7-pin data cable and uses a 15-pin SATA power connector
#### Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVM Express)
only used by SSDs
NVMe vs SATA
- most common SATA standard, SATA r, transfers data at 6Gb/s
- NVMe uses either PCIe 4.0 or PCIe 3.0, which transfers data at 42Gb/s and 8Gb/s
- The PCIe NVMe interface might be used as a PCIe expansion slot, U.2, U.3, or M.2
### Picking a Hard Drive
Motherboard and drive must support the same interface standard
Options for compatibility
- SATA ports on a motherboard are usually color-coded to indicate which SATA standard the port supports
- M.2 slots might support PCIe 4.0, PCle 3.0, PCle 2.0, SATA2.x, SATA3.x, or USB 3.0
- When an M.2 port with a card installed is using the SATA bus, one of the SATA ports might be disabled
- NVMe expansion cards most likely use a PCIe x4 version 3.0 or newer slot

Other Considerations
- Technology
- Form Factor
- Capacity
- Data transfer rate (Speed)
- For magnetic drives, the spindle speed
### Installing a SATA drive
Might have jumpers used to set features such as the ability to power up from standby
- If jumpers are present on a SATA drive, the factory has set them as they should be

Some SATA drives have 2 power connectors
- Choose only one power connector to be used
- Never install 2 power cords to the drive at the same time
#### Steps
1. Protect the user's data
	- Verify you can access the data

2. Know your starting point
	- How is your system configured
	- is everything working

3. Read the documentation and prepare your work area
	- Read all instructions first
	- Visualize all the steps

4. Install the drive
	- Shut down the PC, unplug it and press the power button to drain residual power
	- Decide which bay to use
	- Slide the drive into the bay and secure it
	- Connect a 15-pin SATA or 4-pin Molex power connector from the PSU to the drive
	- Check all connections
	- Verify setup using BIOS/UEFI
#### Installing a drive in a removable bay
Unplug the cage fan
Turn the handle on each locking device
Slide the bay to the front and out of the case
insert the drive in the bay and use two screws on each side to anchor the drive
Slide the bay back into the case
Reinstall the locking pins
Plug in the cage fan power cord
#### Installing an M.2
Read the manual to figure out what types of M.2 card the board supports
Installing
1. Measure the length of the card and decide which screw hole for the M.2 slot the card requires
2. Slide the card straight into the slot but not from an upward angle
3. Install one screw in the standoff
4. Start the system and confirm you can see the drive in BIOS/UEFI
#### Installing a drive in a laptop with a removable drive bay
1. Power down the system, remove peripherals, remove the battery pack
2. Remove a screw that hold the drive cover in place
3. Remove the plastic cover from the drive and lift and remove the hard drive
4. Insert the new drive in the bay, replace the cover and the screw then power up the system
5. BIOS/UEFI should recognize the new drive and search for an OS
6. If drive is new, boot form Windows Startup or recovery DVD or USB flash drive and install the OS
### Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)
configures two or more drives to work together in an array of drives
Improves performance by writing data to 2 or more drives so that singular drives aren't excessively used
Improves *fault tolerance* by writing 2 copies of it, each to a different drive
#### Types of RAID
*Spanning* - uses 2 drives to hold a single windows volume, when one drive is full it writes to the second one
*RAID 0* - writes to physical disks evenly across all disks so that no one disk receives all activity
*RAID 1* - duplicates data on one drive to another drive and is used for fault tolerance
*RAID 5* - stripes data across drives and uses parity checking and data is not duplicated
*RAID 10* - combination of RAID 1 and RAID 0, takes at least 4 disks, data is mirrored across pairs of disks
