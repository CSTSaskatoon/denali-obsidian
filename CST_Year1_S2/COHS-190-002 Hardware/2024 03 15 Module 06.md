Troubleshoot
# IO Storage
Can be storage and be internal or external.
They need:
- Controlled by software
- Install from manufacturer doc
- Use most recent manufacturer updates from their websites
- Could use third party provider for support
- Some devices need application software to use with a device (firmware and driver)
- Device no faster than slot it is using
- Carefully use administrator account to install device
- Install one device at a time (for troubleshooting)
### Wired and wireless
Wireless still have a dongle plug in somewhere.
Speed of transmission standard is often a tiebreaker.
## Ports
USB is very popular. Can have up to 127 USB devices daisy chained together.
USE are hot-swappable (plug and unplug without powering down).
- Not for data safety

USB has four wires, two for power, two for communication.

### Connector types
USB 1,2, and 3 use an A connector at computer, B connector at device, C connector to universal (3,.0+) 
Thunderbolt are compatible USB connector. - High end displays and charging
eSATA for external storage - Has the HDMI issue of falling out
Lightning connector for Apple
RS-232 connector have been replaced by USB or others.

Video ports are provided by a video card or the motherboard.
Turn off video ports you are not using to avoid confusions.
- Physically block ports that are disabled.

Damaged motherboard ports can be replaced temporarily (stop gap), but you want to replace motherboard since there could be other problems.
## Mice and Keyboard
Simple input devices can be controlled by BIOS/UEFI
- Enable port
- Plug in
- Install driver
- Install software

MnK usually get used by generic drivers by default.
They are also Hot-swappable

PS/2 MnK need the computer to be restarted to use them after they are plugged in.
### Laptop
- Turn off laptop and disconnect battery
- Remove bottom screws
- Remove lid to expose keyboard ribbon cable (delicate)
- Use a spudger to pry keyboard bezel away from case

Embedded in most laptops
Could be installed as external using USB

Install software first, then plug in webcam to USB

Webcams come with built-in microphone
Could microphone port on computer (software to select new input device)
### Graphic Tables (Touch screen)
Sometimes called digitizing tablet, or digitizer to hand draw.
- Use by artists or medical professionals
- Likely connect by and USB and comes with a stylus
## Adapter Cards
Includes NIC, Video card
- Verify it fits
- Room on bus
- Drivers are available
- Use documentation
- If using an onboard port, disable port in BIOS/UEFI
- Install card follow proper procedures
- Plug in all connectors, even extra ones
### Sound cards
Motherboard have onboard sound by default.
- Play and record

Color-coded speakers ports are for speakers and subwoofer (eSATA takes card of this now)
