# Opening the case
Back up important data
Main components installed in the case include the following
- The motherboard, processor, and cooler
- Expansion cards (GPU, Wi-Fi cards)
- Memory Modules
- Hard drives and other drives
- Power Supply
### Power cords vs communication wires
Power wires are high voltage, communication wires are lower voltage and provide information
Power cords almost always lead back to the Power Supply, communication wires go from the motherboard to other components
some cords provide both (USB)
### Memory
A DIMM holds RAM and is mounted directly on a motherboard

==CMOS batteries are what holds the BIOS/UEFI (CMOS is hardware, BIOS/UEFI are software)==
If you have more than one stick of RAM and they are different speeds, **ALL THE RAM WILL RUN AT THE LOWEST SPEED**
### Form Factors
Form factors used by Desktop Cases, Power Supplies, and Motherboards
- Standards that describe the size, shape, screw hole positions and major features of these interconnected components are called form factors
- Form factors are necessary so that all will be compatible with each other
Two form factors used by most desktop and tower computer cases and power supplies include *ATX* (*Advanced Technology Extended*) and *microATX* (smaller version of ATX)
Different Electrical plugs in countries are also form factors
### ATX power supplies
An ATX power supply has a variety of power connectors including the following
- 4 pin and 8 pin auxiliary connectors are used to provide an additional 12 V of power for evolving CPUs
	- The older 20 pin P1 connector still worked in this connector
	- Supported the new PCI Express (PCIe) slots
- 6 pin and 8 pin PCIe connectors connect directly to the video card
	- Video cards draw the most power in the system
### MicroATX
the microATX (mATX) form factor is a major system variation of ATX
Reduces the total cost of a system by implementing the following
- Reduces the number of expansion slots
- Reduces the power supplied to the board
- Allows for a smaller case size
The microATX form factor uses  a 24 pin connector
- not likely to have as many extra wire and connectors as those on the ATX power supply
### Removing Expansion Cards
If removing components, draw a diagram of all cable connections to the motherboard, expansion cards, and drives
To remove expansion cards do the following
- Remove any wire or cable connected to the card
- Remove the screw holding the card to the case
- Grasp the card with both hands and remove it by lifting straight up (you can also very slightly rock the card from end to end)
- Don't put your fingers on the edge connectors or touch a clip
### Removing the Motherboard
Depending on the system, you may have to remove the drives/power supply to get the motherboard
To remove the motherboard do the following
- Unplug the power supply lines
- Unplug SATA cables connected to the motherboard
- Disconnect wires leading from the front of the computer case to the motherboard (Front panel connectors)
- Remove the screws that hold the motherboard to the case
*Post diagnostic Cards* can help discover and report computer errors and conflicts at *power on self test* (*POST*)
- *Firmware* are programs and data stored on the motherboard
- *POST* is a series of tests performed by the startup BIOS/UEFI
If you have a problem that prevents the computer from booting and you suspect it is related to hardware, do the following
- Install the POST card in an expansion slot on the motherboard
	- The card monitors the boot process and reports errors
### Removing the Power Supply
To remove the power supply from the case, do the following
- Look for screws that attach the power supply to the computer case
	- Do not remove screws that hold power supply housing together
- Sometimes power supplies are also attached to the case on the underside by recessed slots
	- Turn the case over and look for slots
	- If present, determine in which direction you need to slide the power supply to free it from the case

### Removing the Drives
A drive receives power by a power cable from the Power Supply and communicates instructions and data through a cable attached to the motherboard
Tips to remove drives
- Look for screws on each side of the drive attaching the drive to the drive bay
- There might be a catch underneath the drive
- Some drive bays have a clipping mechanism to hold the drive in the bay
- Some drives must be removed through the front of the case
- Some cases have a removable bay for smaller hard drives
### Putting a computer back together
Refer to any diagrams created during the disassembling process
