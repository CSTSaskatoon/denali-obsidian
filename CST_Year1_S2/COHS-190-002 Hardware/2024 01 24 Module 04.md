### Selecting a Power Supply
Reasons to replace a power supply includes
- Power supply fails
- Power supply is not adequate
When building a new system, you have the following options
- you can purchase a computer case with the power supply already installed
- You can purchase a power supply separate from the case
### Types and Characteristics of Power Supplies
Important power supply feature considerations include
- The form factor determines it's size
- Wattage ratings (listed in documentation and the side of the power supply)
- Number and types of connectors
- Fans inside the PSU
- Dual voltage options
- Extra features
- Vendor reputation and Warranty
A *redundant power supply (RPS)* uses two identical power supplies

### How to calculate Wattage Capacity
When deciding what wattage capacity you need, consider
- The total wattage requirements of all components inside the case as well as all USB devices that get power from the motherboard
Keep these two points in mind when selecting wattage
- Video cards draw the most power
- The power supply should be rates 30% higher than the expected needs
To know what size of power supply you need, add the wattage requirements and add 30%

Be on the same level for an interview
Interview the user and back up data before you make any changes to the system
Examine the system, analyze the problem, and make an initial determination of the source of the problem
Test your theory
After you know the source of the problem, plan what to do to fix the problem and then fix it
Verify that the problem is fixed and that the system works
Document activities, outcomes, and what you learned
Troubleshooting resources
- The web
- Chat, forums, or email technical support
- manufacturer's diagnostic software
- User manuals
- Technical associates in your organization
### Troubleshooting Rules
1. Approach the problem systematically
2. Establish your priorities
3. Beware of User Error
4. Keep your cool and don't rush
5. Make no assumptions
6. Try the simple things worst
7. Become a researcher
8. Divide and conquer
9. Write things down
10. Don't assume the worst
11. Reboot and start over
12. Use the least invasive solution first
13. Know your starting point
### Interviewing the user and backing up data
Possible questions (*Open and Closed Questions*)
- Can you describe the problem? What error messages, unusual displays, or failures did you see? (open)
- When did the problem start? (closed)
- What was the situation when the problem occurred? (open)
- What programs or software were you using? (open)
- What changes have been recently made to the system? (open)
- has there been a recent thunderstorm or electrical problem? (closed)
- Have you made any hardware, software or configuration changes? (open or closed)
As you talk with the user, keep in mind rules 2, 3, and 4
2. Establish your priorities
3. Beware of User Error
4. Keep your cool and don't rush
*Be sure to back up any important data before you begin work on the computer*
Options to backup
- Use explorer to copy the data to another system
- Move the hard drive to another system
- Hire a professional file recovery service
### Examining the System and Making Your Best Guess
Rules 5 and 6 can help as you start solving the problem
5. Make no assumptions
6. Try the simple things first
Follow this procedure to form your best guess
- reproduce the problem and observe for yourself
- Decide if the problem is hardware or software related
- Make your best guess as to the source of the problem, and don't forget to question the obvious
7. Become a researcher
### Testing your Theory
As you test your theories, keep in mind rules 8-11
8. Divide and Conquer
9. Write things down
10. Don't assume the worst
11. Reboot and start over

### Planning your solution and then fixing the problem
When planning and implementing your solution, keep rules 12 and 13 in mind
12. Use the least invasive solution first
13. Know your starting point
Consider the following
- Using different solutions and select the least invasive one
- Before applying your solution, do your bets to determine what works and doesn't work in the system so you know your starting point
- Fix the problem
If you don't have *technical documentation* on hand, search the product manufacturer's website
### Verifying the Fix and taking preventative action
After fixing the problem, reboot the system and verify everything works
Can you do the following
- Reach the internet
- use the printer
- use Microsoft office
If possible, have the user check everything and verify the job is done satisfactorily
After verifying all is working, ask the following question
- Could this problem have been prevented
### Documentation
Good documentation helps you do the following
- Take what you learned into the next troubleshooting situation
- Train others
- Develop effective presentation maintenance plans
- Satisfy any audits or customer or employee queries about your work
Be sure to include the following items
- Initial symptoms
- Source of the problem
- Your troubleshooting steps
### Troubleshooting the Electrical System
The following are possible symptoms of a problem with the electrical system
- The computer appears "dead" - no indicator lights/spinning drive/fans
- The computer sometimes locks up during booting
- Error codes or beeps occur while booting
- You smell burnt parts or odors
- The computer powers down at unexpected times
- The computer appears dead, but you hear a whine coming from the PSU
Here are some questions to ask and things to do to solve a problem with the electrical system
- If you smell any burnt parts or odors, don't turn it on
	- Identify the component that is fried and repace it
- When you first plug up power to a system and hear a whine coming from the PSU, the power supply might be inadequate for the system or there might be a short
- Is the power cord plugged in
- Is the power outlet controlled by a wall switch
- Are there any cable connections loose
If you need to look inside the computer case turn off the computer, unplug it, press the power button to drain residual power and open the case
- Check all power connections from the power supply to the motherboard and drives
- If you smell burnt parts, carefully search for shorts and for frayed/burnt wires
- If you suspect the power supply is bad, test it with a power supply tester
### Problems that come and go
Symptoms that might indicate an intermittent problem with the electrical system after the boot
- Computer stops or hangs for no reason
- Memory errors appears intermittently
- Data is written incorrectly to the hard drive or files are corrupted
- Keyboard stops working at odd times
- The motherboard fails or is damaged
- The power supply overheats and becomes hot the touch
- The power supply fan whines and becomes very noisy or stops
