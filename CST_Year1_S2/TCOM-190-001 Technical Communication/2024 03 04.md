# Documentation and Plagiarism
### Necessity of Documentation
Every word/idea must be documented
### Things that don't need credit
Writing your own
- Lived experiences
- Observations or insights
- Conclusions about a subject
- Results obtained through lab or field experiments
- Artwork, digital photographs, video, audio, etc.

"Common knowledge"
Generally accepted facts
### Common knowledge
Find the same information undocumented in at least five credible sources
Something your readers will already know, or something that a person could easily find in general reference sources
### Safe practices
Reading and note taking
Writing paraphrases or summaries
Writing direct quotations
Writing about another person's ideas
Maintaining drafts of your work
Revising, proofreading, and finalizing your work
### Reading and note-taking
mark someone else's words
Indicate in your notes which ideas are taken from sources
Record relevant documentation in your notes
