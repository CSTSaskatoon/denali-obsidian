# Direct vs Paraphrasing
### Direct
authors name in the same sentence as the quote
Mark the quote with quotation marks or set it off from your own text in a block
#### Example
According to Gordon Mah Ung (2017), “AMD knows that people who buy 8-core CPUs tend to like cranking their systems to 11” (p. 20)
AMD anticipates users who “tend to like cranking their systems to 11” (Mah Ung, 2017, p. 20)
### Paraphrasing/Summarizing
Check your paraphrase or summary against the original text and the sentence/paragraph structure
Don't change the meaning
Put quotation marks around any unique words or phrases you don't want to change
#### Example
AMD tailors its product to meet the needs of 8-core CPU consumers, many of whom demand a lot from their systems (Mah Ung, 2017)
