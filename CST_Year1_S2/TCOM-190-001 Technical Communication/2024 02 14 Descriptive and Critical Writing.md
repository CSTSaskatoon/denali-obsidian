#### Description
Sporks are a type of cutlery with a fork at one end and a spoon at the other. Sporks are often made of plastic rather than metal like traditional cutlery and, as a result, may come in a variety of different colours (Wilson, 2016). Sporks can be used to eat all forms of dinners, both liquid and solid (McLean, 2012).
#### Question
Critically analyse the value of sporks in modern society

#### Description
As sporks combine all forms of cutlery in one implement, they reduce the volume of washing up required. Campbell (2012) and Rodgers (2018) argue that the reduction in water usage could have environmental benefits. On the other hand, the limited lifespan of plastic sporks compared to traditional metal cutlery could have a detrimental effect on the environment by adding plastic waste to landfill (Dewar, 2019).
