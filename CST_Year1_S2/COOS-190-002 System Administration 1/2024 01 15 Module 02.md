s# Two types of formatting
Low Level formatting - what the company makes the drives does to define the sectors
High level formatting - what you do when you select a file system cluster sizes
Quick format - flushes tables
Not Quick format - writes and reads to each table (effectively testing the drive) - only really necessary if you have issues with your drive
### VHD and VHDX file types
Virtual hard disk (VHD) is a file that emulates a physical disk
Can be attached to a physical computer or Virtual Machine (VM)
After it's attached, it appears in the system just like a physical disk
- Can be initialized as MBR or GPT
- Can be configured as basic or dynamic
- Can create partitions or volumes and format them with a file system
When fully configured, it'll be listed in Windows File Explorer
- Can interact with it as if it's a physical disk
The older format for  VHD files uses the .vhd extenstion
- .vhd files have a max size of 2TB
The newer format uses the .vhdx extension
- .vhdx files have a max size of 64TB
.vhdx files offer better resilience, with the ability to recover from errors
Most common use is to attach a VHD to a VM
- it'll appear as a physical disk in the VM
You can also attach a VHD to a physical computer
You can manage VHD files with Disk Management and diskpart
### What are disk Volumes?
Simple volumes/partitions
- Reside on one disk
- Can be extended to contiguous or non-contiguous space
	- If you try to extend a partition on a basic disk to non-contiguous space, you'll be prompted to convert it to dynamic
Spanned volumes (Require dynamic disks)
- The volume spans multiple disks
- Display in File Explorer as a single volume
- Aren't fault tolerant
	- If a disk that's part of a spanned volume fails, you lose the entire volume
	Ex. ![](Pasted%20image%2020240115104327.png)
Striped Volumes (Requires Dynamic Disks) (*Faster speeds, 0 redundancy*) - RAID 0 (0 Fault tolerance)
- Data is striped across multiple two or more disks (up to 32)
- Excellent read and write performance
- Aren't fault tolerant (Essentially decreases tolerance)
- Can't be extended or shrunk
Mirrored Volumes (Requires Dynamic Disks) (*Redundancy*) - RAID 1 (1 drive of redundancy)
- Volume is mirrored on two disks
- Don't get better performance (Theoretically you could have better reads but that's not how it works)
- Provides fault tolerance
- Can't be extended or shrunk
RAID-5 Volume (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) - RAID 5 ()
- Striping with Parity
- Ex. ![500](Pasted%20image%2020240115105549.png)
- Provides Fault tolerance
	- If one of the disks fail, you can still access the volume
- Excellent read performance, good write performance
- Can't be extended, shrunk, or mirrored
- RAID is also known as Redundant Array of Independent Disks
*Operating system should be a mirror not RAID-5* because your PC can't understand RAID-5 until it's started, whereas with Mirrored it will boot like normal and then realize it's supposed to be mirrored. Then you can also have your data as RAID-5 for redundancy
### System and Boot Volumes
**THESE ARE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY SAY** 
![600](Pasted%20image%2020240115111303.png)
When you install Windows Server 2022, windows creates both a System volume and a boot volume on the disk you installed on. However, this terminology is confusing
System volume is the volume the OS boots from. This is a small volume containing the windows boot loader (called Bootmgr) and boot configuration data (BCD). The boot loader begins loading the OS and reads the BCD
Boot Volume is the volume that contains the rest of the OS files in a filder called Windows and it's subfolders. It also contains the Users folder, where user profiles are stored, and the Program Files folder where applications are installed
### Diskpart
diskpart - starts the diskpart utility
list disks - shows available hard drives
select disk 1 - selects disk one (**DOES NOT SHOW WHAT DRIVE YOU ARE ON AFTER YOU SELECT THE DISK**)
help - opens help page
exit - leaves diskpart
### Making a spanned volume
create a new spanned volume
select the second drive that you want to span it on
if your disks are basic it will convert them to dynamic
### Striped Volume
Create a new striped volume
pick what disks you want to stripe
Stripes have to be the same size (*Smallest Drive wins*)
### Mirrored Drive
Create a new Mirrored volume
select which drive you want to mirror
Will convert drives to dynamic if they aren't already
Can break a mirror because it has a full copy one drive (*No other drive can do this*)
### RAID-5
Need at least 3 drives, it will make them all the same size
### Example with all the different Volume types

### Mounting a drive in an NTFS folder
In linux you can mount drives with a name instead of a letter
In windows server, you can mount a drive as a folder (*Has to be empty and NTFS*)
essentially just pointing you back to a different drive (*Looks like a folder but acts like a shortcut*)
### Extend and Shrink Volumes
On dynamic disks, you can extend a volume to contiguous or non-contiguous space
On basic disks, you can't extend to non-contiguous space
Volumes must be formatted with NTFS or ReFS
Extending volumes is non-destructive
You can create a spanned disk, whereby you extend a volume onto another disk
- can include between two and 32 disks
- Spanned disks aren't fault tolerant
- It's useful if one disk runs out of space
- All disks must be dynamic
- Spanned volumes display in different colors
Only volumes formatted with NTFS can be shrunk
Reclaims unused space at the end of a volume
- Works backwards from the end until it encounters a file or fragment, which can limit how much you can shrink it (*Defragment/clean up files beforehand*)
Some files are immovable, such as windows paging file, which means it can't be shrunk
- Configure windows to relocate immovable files
A fragmented volume can have file fragments at the end of a volume
- Run the Windows Defragment and Optimization app
