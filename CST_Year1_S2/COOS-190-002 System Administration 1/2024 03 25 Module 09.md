# Implement failover clustering for Hyper-V machines
### Options for making applications/services highly available
*Host clustering*
- VMs are highly available
- Doesn't require VM OS or application to be cluster-aware

*Guest Clustering*
- VM are failover cluster nodes
- VM applications are cluster-aware (*Application is aware of when the cluster needs to take over*)
- Requires Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) or virtual Fibre Channel interface for Shared Storage Applications
- **Still a single point of failure because it's one physical server**

*Network Load Balancing* (*NLB*)
- VMs are NLB cluster nodes
- Used for web-based applications
### How does a failover cluster work with Hyper-V nodes
Treats VMs like any other application/service
Only one node at a time can run the VM
Possible to move the VM to any other node in the same cluster as a part of a planned migration/failover
### Failover clustering features specific to Hyper-V
Maximum nodes and VM support
File share storage
- `.vhdx`
- `.vhd` - *Windows server 2016 and later*

Shared virtual disk option for shared storage
VM configuration version
### Best practices for High Availability in a virtual environment
Plan for failover scenarios
Plan the network design for failover clustering
Plan the shared storage for failover clustering
Use the default failover cluster quorum mode
Deploy standardized Hyper-V hosts
Develop standard management practices
## Implement and maintain Hyper-V host clustering

### Prerequisites for Implementing Hyper-V failover clustering
*Hardware Requirements*
- Server hardware
- Network adapters
- Storage adapters
- Storage

Cluster nodes should be in the same *Active Directory Domain Service* (*ADDS*)
Ensure you have admin on cluster nodes
### Steps
1. Install and configure Windows Server 2022
2. Configure shared storage
3. Install the Hyper-V and Failover Clustering Features
4. Validate the cluster configuration
5. Create the cluster
6. Create a VM on one of the cluster nodes
7. Make the VM highly available (for an existing VM)
8. Test the failover
### Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV)
CSVs allow multiple cluster nodes to have read/write access simultaneously to the same disk
Benefits
- Fewer logical unit members (LUN)s required
- Improved use of disk space
- VM fields are in a single logical location
- No special hardware
- Increased resiliency
### Shared VHD
Adds an additional layer of abstraction for VM cluster storage
Shared VHD is used as a shared storage and 
- VMs don't need access to iSCSI or failover clustering storage area network (SAN)
- Presented as a virtual SCSI disk

Requirements
- Must be in `.vhdx` or `.vhds` format
- Connected by using virtual SCSI adapter
- Stored on a scale-out file server (CSV)
- Windows Server 2016 or newer is supported OS
### Scale-out file servers for VMs
Can engage all nodes simultaneously, working in active-active mode
Can store VM files on a SMB 3.0 file share
File servers need to run Windows Server 2016 or newer
Needs to be configured as a Scale-out file server for application data
Use Hyper-V manager to create or move VM files to a SMB file share
### Considerations
Applications that require high availability
Application components that must be highly available
Application characteristics
Total capacity requirements
Windows Server Hyper-V Live Migration considerations
- Verify basic hardware requirements
- Configure a dedicated network adapter or virtual network adapter
- Use similar host hardware
- Verify network connection
### Drain on shutdown
When placing a Hyper-V failover cluster node in a paused state, also referred to as maintenance mode, live migration is used to migrate all VMs on that node to others in the cluster
A feature called draining on shutdown resolves the issue of potential VM downtime
It drains the roles first by using live migrations instead of quick migrations
Use *`(Get-Cluster).DrainOnShutdown`* to verify if the feature is enabled.
