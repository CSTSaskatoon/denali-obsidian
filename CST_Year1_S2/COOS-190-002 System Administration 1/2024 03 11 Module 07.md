### Overview of Windows Server backup
Copying volumes doesn't create consistent backups
- Takes a long time
- Modifies files during copy
- Opens some files but then can't copy them

Uses VSS to create consistent snapshot
You can back up
- A full server (all volumes) or just specific volumes
- Individual files and folders
- System state
- Individual VMs on a Hyper-V host

backup can be created on a local volume or on a file share
restore can be performed from Windows Server or as a bare-metal operation
WBAdmin is a command-line tool built into windows server
#### Different WS backups
Full Server
- includes all server data, installed apps, system state
- Requires most space

Whole volume/individual folders/files
- Self explanatory

System State
- Includes OS, Startup and registry files, other role-specific files
- If restored, OS has the same name, domain membership and roles as it was when backed up

Bare-metal
- Includes OS files and data, data on critical volumes
- Always includes System state and system volume (C:)

Individual VMs and the host component
- Can create backups for individual VMs while they are running
### Implementing backups
Can either backup once or on a regular schedule
Depending on what you need to back up, the procedures and options in windows server backup may vary
Most common backup procedures
- file servers/web servers
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Microsoft Exchange Server
- Hyper-V host
# Failover Clustering
### What is Failover clustering
Not the only component of high availability
group of computers that work together to increase availability/scalability of clustered roles
- Clustered servers (nodes) are connected by physical cables and software
- If one or more nodes fail, other nodes begin to provide service (*failover*) - little to no downtime
- Clustered nodes are monitored to verify they are working
- If they're not working they are restarted or moved to another node

Common applications for failover clustering
- Highly available file share storage for applications (SQL server/Hyper-V VMs)
- Clustered roles that run on physical servers
- Databases running SQL Server
#### Availability
Level of service expressed as a percentage of time
- Highly available services or systems are available >99%
- Requirements differ based on how availability is measured
- Planned outages typically aren't included when calculating availability

Results in more costs/investments
Needs support of business decision makers
#### Terminology
##### Infrastructure
Cluster node - server that provides availability/redundancy inside a cluster
Active cluster node
Passive cluster node
Cluster resource
Cluster sets
Cluster network
Cluster storage
Cluster resource group
Virtual server
##### Failover
Cluster quorum
Cluster storage volumes (CSVs)
Shared disk
Cluster witness
Witness disk or share
Azure Cloud Witness
Heartbeat
Storage replica
Private storage
##### Tools/Features
Cluster Performance history
Cross-domain cluster migration
Persistent memory
