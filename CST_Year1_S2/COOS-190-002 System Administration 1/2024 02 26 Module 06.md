# Deploy and manage Windows Server and Hyper-V containers
## Containerization Video
Linux first introduced C-groups as a primitive form of containers
### 3 Step Process
1. Documentation
2. Create the image
3. Now you have the container itself
### Advantages of Containers

## Notes
#### What are the benefits of using containers?
- *Agility and productivity* - accelerated development, improved consistency across environments, empowered autonomous teams improving productivity and quality.
- *Fine-grained resilience* - independent deployment of highly available components to remove single points of failure.
- *Scalability and infrastructure optimization* - fine-grained dynamic scaling and maximized component/resource density to make best use of infrastructure resources.
- *Operational consistency* - homogeneous administration of heterogeneous components, reducing the range of skillsets required to operate the environments.
- *Component portability* - portability across nodes, environments, and clouds, ensuring choice when selecting platforms.
