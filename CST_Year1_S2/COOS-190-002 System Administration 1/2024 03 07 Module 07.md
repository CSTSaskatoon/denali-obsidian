# Network Load Balancing (NLB)
You generally don't use a failover cluster and network load balancing at the same time
*General idea is distributing the network activity across multiple servers (Application servers)*
can be done via hardware or software
Application servers use private IPs that are not seen by the user
Essentially user just sees one IP that they are connecting to and not the IP of the specific Application server they are connecting to
Can either split the load evenly or have it weighted towards certain servers
### What is NLB
Works with both physical server components and virtual server workloads
transparently distributes IP traffic to multiple instances of the application on different servers
can add more servers to the cluster
appropriate solution for resources that don't have to accommodate exclusive read/write requests
### Deployment Requirements
Cluster nodes have to be deployed in the same subnet
configure all network adapters in cluster as either multicast or unicast
IP addresses of the servers in an NLB cluster are static
Nodes are all running the same version of Windows server
Nodes all have similar hardware specs
*Basically, all your servers in the cluster should work the same and have the same specs*
### Config Options
NLB directs traffic depending on the port and protocol and whether the client has an existing network session with a host in the cluster
#### Port Rules
Allows you to control the flow of traffic on the cluster
Multiple Hosts
Single Host
Disable this port range
#### Affinity
defines how the cluster distributes requests from a particular client
None - your request goes to any server in the cluster (stateless)
Single - remembers which server you were connected to before (stateful)
Network - splits it based on network
# Backups
### Windows Server backup
Copying a volume doesn't create consistent backups
Takes a long time
Modifies files during the copy operation
Opens some files but then can't copy them
