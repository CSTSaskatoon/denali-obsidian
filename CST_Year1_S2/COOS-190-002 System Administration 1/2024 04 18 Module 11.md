# Overview of baseline, trends, and capacity planning
### Bottlenecks
hardware or software component that impacts a computers performance
Four major bottleneck components
- Processor
- Disk
- Memory
- Network Interface

Server's role determines which components are most important to monitor

You should establish a baseline and review the four key resources mentioned above
### Monitoring Services
#### DNS
Measure and review general DNS server stats
Review both TCP and UDP counters
Review Dynamic updates
Track memory usage and memory allocation
Review counters for recursive lookups
Review zone-transfer traffic
#### DHCP
Review the Average Queue Length counter
Review the Milliseconds per packet (Avg) counter
### Considerations for monitoring VMs
*Hyper-V Resource Metering tool* - for VMs
Average GPU usage
Average physical memory usage (Min and Max)
Max disk space allocation
Incoming network traffic for a NIC
Outgoing network traffic for a NIC
### Server Manager
displays a summary of Event log data on the dashboard
- Can review event info for both local and remote servers in *All Servers* tab
- Select a role in *navigation* pane and review related events
### Custom View
click *Create Custom View* and pick
- Logged
- Event level
- By log
- By source
- Additional options
### Event log subscriptions
Enables you to gather events, filtered or not which you can review in a single log
Works by using *Windows Remote Management* and *Windows Event Controller Services*
Can either be *Collector-initiated* or *Source initiated*
Must complete a number of steps to enable subscriptions in event logs
- On the source of computers, run this in cmd `winrm quickconfig`
- ON the collector computer, run this in cmd `wecutil qc`
- On each of the source computers, add the computer account of the collector computer to the *`EventLogReaders`* group
