### Comparison and Scenarios for Usage
DAS - Direct Access Storage
- Least complex
- Lowest setup costs
NAS - Network Attached Storage
- Best solution for specific situations
- Complementary to DAS and SAN
SAN - Storage Access Storage
- Highest performing
- Most expensive
- Has the most features
- Future Trends
	- Windows server storage features are expanding to improve capabilities when using DAS
NAS vs SAN (*On SAN, the users think storage is on the server, but in reality it's its own thing*)

When should you use DAS/NAS/SAN?

### When to use DAS
Based on it's characteristics, you might be tempted to use DAS for single-server environments or when you want to reduce costs
### When to use NAS

### When to use SAN
![700](Pasted%20image%2020240122103313.png)
Can often expand to be extremely large
### File level storage
![700](Pasted%20image%2020240122103412.png)
NAS and DAS are both file-level access
### Block level storage

*If you only change one thing in a 2GB file, it only changes that specific block instead of copying the whole thing like it would with file-level access*
For data deduplication, if you have 10 word docs that are 90% the same, it will have one block for the 90% that is the same and separate blocks for the non-duplicate parts to reduce size
SANs tend to be blocks
### Object level storage
![800](Pasted%20image%2020240122104140.png)
more like a "Searching system" than file access

# Understanding iSNS, datacenter bridging, and MPIO
### What is iSNS
![700](Pasted%20image%2020240122113522.png)
Not used that much because most network storage is static, it's not going to change a lot over months/years
### Data Center Bridging
![700](Pasted%20image%2020240122113836.png)
Maintaining quality of service (prioritizing VOIP over downloads, etc.)
**NEED** to use Windows Server Datacenter and have the correct hardware
### DCB

### Multiple Path Input/Output (MPIO)
