# Creating and managing Deployment Images
Need to decide what type of image you are putting on the machine
- depends on what it will be used for

*`.wim`* - Windows Imaging Format
- file-based disk image format
- Hardware independence
- Multiple images in a single file
- Single instancing
- Offline servicing (mount and change image)
- Non-destructive deployment
### Overview of images
`.wim` files contain all of the files and information for one or more disk images
*WIMBoot* files allow a computer to run directly form a `.wim` file and reduce the space requirements for Windows installations

#### Types of images
*Thin images* - only contains OS and possibly a few agents such as Configuration Manager agent
*Thick images* - Contains every driver, app, and customization required by an end user
*Hybrid images* - Contains some of the drivers, apps and customizations required by most users
Thick images are better when you have a lot of the same hardware over all the computers because of drivers
#### Boot and install images
*Boot Image*
- Windows PE
	- Pre Installation Environment
	- suited for deployment and recovery practices
	- designed to be booted from the network, cd, USB, DVD

- On install media, `boot.wim`
- 32-bit and 64-bit platform support
- Used to capture and deploy operating systems

*Install Image*
- The OS
- On install media, `install.wim`
- Generally based on a captured reference computer
#### Image Based installation tools
*`Setup.exe`*
- Performs Windows install by using interactive or unattended installation methods
- Can be used with answer files (`unattend.xml`) and catalog with Windows System Image Manager (SIM)
- Catalog - contains all available components and packages you can use as a part of `unattend.xml` file
	- Can modify components and packages through SIM

*Windows Deployment Services* - Role on Windows Server
*Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK)* - Contains Windows PE Images
*Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)*
- command line and PowerShell tool for servicing Windows OS images

*System Center Configuration Manager* - Comprehensive, enterprise-level suite for deployment/management
#### Create, update and maintain images
1. Create capture image
2. Customize the reference computer
3. Generalize the reference computer
4. Capture the reference image
##### Consider
Storage Requirements
Apps and other software
Deployment of device drivers
image updates
- Using Windows Setup to customize images
- Online Servicing
- Offline Servicing
#### Windows ADK
Can help you manage deployment
Application Compatibility Toolkit - Allows you to determine app compatibility within your organization
Deployment Tools -  Includes DISM and related command line tools
Windows SIM - Enables you to create unattended Windows Setup answer files
Windows PE - Enables you to start a computer prior to deploying an image to the computer
Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer
- Enables you to create provisioning packages which can be used to customize the configuration of your computers during the out of box experience (OOBE)

User State Migration Tool (USMT)
Volume Activation Management Tool
Windows Performance Toolkit
Windows Assessment Toolkit
Creating/editing answer files

#### Windows Deployment Services
Server role provided with Windows Server
Enables you to perform network-based installations
Simplifies deployment process
Supports deployment to computers with no OS
Uses existing technologies such as Windows PE, `.wim`, `.vhd` and `.vhdx` files, image based deployment

Consists of two role services
- Deployment Server
- Transport Server

Provides 3 management tools
- WDS snap in
- WDSUTIL
- WDS Windows PowerShell cmdlets
#### Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT)
Delivers end-to-end guidance for planning, building, and deploying Windows operating systems
Enables deployment of Windows OS by using *lite-touch installation* (*LTI*) or *zero-touch installation* (*ZTI*)

##### Create images in MDT
![800](Pasted%20image%2020240408112305.png)
##### Available MDT task sequence templates
Sysprep and Capture
Standard Client Task Sequence
Standard Client Replace Task Sequence
Standard Client Upgrade Task Sequence
Lite-touch OEM Task Sequence
Standard Server Task Sequence
Standard Server Upgrade Task Sequence
Post OS Installation Task Sequence
Deploy to VHD Client Task Sequence
Deploy tp VHD Server Task Sequence
Custom Task Sequence
##### Deploying Images in MDT
When you start a computer using LTI boot media, the MDT program starts automatically and the following actions occur
- `Bootstrap.ini` file is processed
- Computer connects to deployment share

Selecting *Run the Deployment Wizard*
- *Credentials* dialog box displays
- *`CustomSettings.ini`* file processes
- *Task Sequence* page displays
- After, the wizard proceeds to display the pages that are relevant for the type of deployment task sequence template used

*Advanced Configuration* contains several items you can use to extend LTI deployment features
- Linking deployment shares
- Support for standalone media
- Configuring for *MDT database*

Using *Selection Profiles* enables you to create groups of folders in the *Deployment workbench*. You can use profiles in several different locations
- *Deployment Share Properties*
- *Inject Drivers* task step
- *Apply Patches* task step
- *New Media* Wizard
- *New Linked Deployment Share* Wizard

*MAP*
- Used to perform network wide deployment readiness assessment which can help you decide if you can migrate MS technologies to a virtual environment
### Solution for Server virtualization
Determine virtualization scope
determine workloads
determine backup and fault tolerance requirements for each workload
use MAP to aid in the design of the virtualization hosts
MAP workloads to hosts
Design host backup and fault tolerance
Determine storage requirements
Determine network requirements
