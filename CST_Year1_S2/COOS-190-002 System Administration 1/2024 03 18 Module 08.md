# Cluster Storage
### Configure and manage cluster storage
configure tasks in failover clustering include
- Adding storage spaces
- Adding a disk to available storage and to the Cluster Shared Volume (CSV)
- Taking a disk offline
- Bringing a disk online
### Configure networking
One network can support client and node communication
Multiple network adapters are recommended for enhanced performance and redundancy
iSCSI storage should have a dedicated network
### Quorum options
Typical settings
Add or change *Quorum Witness*
Advanced quorum configuration and witness selection
### Monitoring Failover clusters
Event viewer
`Tracerpt.exe`
Performance and Reliability Monitor
- Monitor performance based on baseline on each node
- Modify trace log settings
### Backup and restore Failover-cluster configuration
Windows server Backup is a windows feature
Non-Microsoft tools are available to perform backups and restores
Must perform system-state backups
*Nonauthoritative* restore completely restores a single node in the cluster
*Authoritative* restore restores the entire cluster configuration to a point in time
### Manage and troubleshoot failover clusters
#### Troubleshooting
using *Validate a Configuration Wizard*
Reviewing events in logs (cluster, hardware, storage)
Defining a process for troubleshooting failover clusters
Reviewing storage configuration
Checking for group and resource failures
#### Configuration tasks
Managing cluster nodes
Managing cluster networks
Managing permissions
Configuring quorum settings
Migrating services and applications to a cluster
Configuring new services to work in a cluster
Removing a cluster
### Heartbeat traffic
#### Aggressive
always monitoring
More uptime
may falsely enter failover if you get a lot of errors
#### Relaxed
Takes longer to notice when something is wrong
less false failovers
### Cluster Aware Updating (CAU)
Enables admins to update cluster nodes automatically with little or no loss in availability during the update process
#### Works in two modes
Remote updating

Self updating

### Communication Issues
Network Latency
Network failures
Network adapter driver issues
Firewall rules
Security software
can use `Get-ClusterLog` to generate the `Cluster.log` file for troubleshooting
- can find in `C:\Windows\Cluster\Reports`
