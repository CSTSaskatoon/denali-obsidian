# Notes
*HyperVisor is the generic term for a VM (Could be VMware, Hyper-V, Virtual Box*
### Managing Hyper-V with Hyper-V manager
GUI interface that lets you manage local and remote Hyper-V host machines
Supports
- Previous versions
- Web Services (WS)-management protocol
- Alternate credential support
Can also use PowerShell, PowerShell Direct
### Containers and Docker in Hyper-V
VMs provide hardware virtualization (Own OS)
###### Containers provide operating systems (OS) virtualization
- Isolated namespace
- Controlled space hardware

###### Benefits of containers
- Ability to run anywhere
- Isolation
- Increased efficiency
- A consistent development environment

Docker is the management software for containers 
Hyper-V containers provide greater isolation
Most Containers are Brand specific (Linux one won't work on windows) because it needs the operating system
Containers are useful if you don't want applications to change things on the Host OS

### Windows Server containers and Docker in Hyper-V
![](Pasted%20image%2020240212104825.png)
Basically good for development, trying changes to the system
### Prerequisites and requirements for installing Hyper-V
user `Systeminfo.exe` to verify that hardware requirements are met for Hyper-V
The host must have sufficient resources to meet the requirements for the VMs
- Processor
- Memory
- Storage
- Network
###### System Requirements
![](Pasted%20image%2020240212105258.png)
64-bit processor with second-level access address translation (SLAT)
A processor with VM Monitor Mode extensions
A minimum of 4 GB of Memory
Hardware-enforced, Data Execution Prevention (DEP)-enabled (Intel XD bit, AMD NX bit)
### Nested Virtualization
Lets you run Hyper-V inside a Hyper-V VM
Useful for
- Running applications or emulators in a nested VM
- Testing software releases on VMs
- Reducing deployment times for training environments
- Using Hyper-V isolation for containers

Modern processors include features that makes virtualization faster and more secure
VM-based nested virtualization can introduce significant performance overheads
Provides the ability to install the Hyper-V role within a guest
- Both the Hyper-V host and guest VM must be Windows Server 2016 or newer
- Must have enough RAM
- MAC Spoofing enabled

To enable virtualization extensions run this PS command
- `Set-VMProcessor -VMName <VMName> -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true`
### Storage Options in Hyper-V
![](Pasted%20image%2020240212111348.png)
Second generation has bigger sizes, but the starting sizes are bigger, and it's not backwards compatible
#### Shared VHDX - reduces the complexity of creating shared virtual disks

#### Storage Options Table
![600](Pasted%20image%2020240212111419.png)
*Make sure you have enough space if you are making a dynamic disk*
#### Parent/Child VMs
You can have a single *parent disk* that you then copy into the *child disk* when it starts up, records the changes the child disk makes instead of an entire copy of the disk
- If you make changes to the parent, it breaks all the children
- Useful if you have a lot of similar disks
#### Pass-through
Shouldn't use as much
uses a physical disk
not as portable
### Considerations for VHD formats and types
use VHDx unless you need backwards compatibility
dynamically expanding VHDx is suitable for production workloads
free space shown by dynamically expanding VHDs is not equal to the physical disk size
### Fiber Channel Support in Hyper-V
virtual adapter 
### Where to store VHDs
High performance Connection to storage
High-performance storage
Redundant Storage
Redundant Connectivity
Adequate growth space
*Essentially, a SAN is perfect for this*
### Store VMs on SMB 3.0 shares
Hyper-V can store the following on an SMB 3.0 file share
- Config files
- VHDs
- Checkpoint files
#### Scale-out file server
- enhances resiliency of SMB file shares in failover, clustering scenarios, combine the benefits of the scale-out file server cluster role, SMB multichannel, SMB direct
