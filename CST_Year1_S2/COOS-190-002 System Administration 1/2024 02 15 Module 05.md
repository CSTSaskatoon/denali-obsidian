# Configure networking on Hyper-V host servers
### Types of Hyper-V virtual switches
##### Hyper-V supports
- External
- Internal
- Private
##### You can use *Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS)* capture and windows filtering platform extensions
- Defines a set of functions that a network adapter drive must implement to work with a network protocol stack

*Virtual local Area Networks (VLANs) are supported*
### Best Practices
When configuring virtual networks
- Use NIC Teaming on the Hyper-V host to ensure connectivity to VMs if an adapter fails
	- *Redundancy, also switch-level teaming*

- Enable bandwidth management to ensure that no single VM monopolizes the network interface (QoS)
- Use network adapters that support Virtual Machine Queue (VMQ)
	- works like multithreading

- Use network virtualization to isolate VMs without using VLANS.
### Advanced Networking Features with Hyper-V
QoS
Dynamic Virtual Machine Multi Queues (VMMQ)
Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) support for virtual switches
Switch Embedded Teaming (SET)
### VM Configuration Versions
To identify config version, run
- `Get-VM * | Format-Table Name. Version`

To update config version, run (*always sets to highest version available*)
- `Stop-VM -Name <vmname>`
- `Update-VMVersion <vmname> -Confirm $false`
- `Start-VM -Name <vmname>`

### VM Generation Versions

*Use Generation 2 whenever you can*

### Hot Adding in Hyper-V
Add more memory/network (and maybe hard drives) adapters without turning off the machine
requires Gen 2 VMs
### Shielded (Encrypted) VMs
A shielded VM is
- Protected against anyone with access to the Hyper-V host
- A Gen 2 VM with a virtual TPM
- Uses Bitlocker encryption

The Host Guardian service has two modes
- Admin-trusted Attestation
- TPM-trusted Attestation
- The host guardian service runs on a Windows Service Cluster
### Best Practices for Configuring VMs
Use dynamic memory unless the application doesn't support it
Avoid using different disks for the same VM
Use multiple network adapters to separate physical volumes for high availability
Store each VM's files on a separate volume
*Gen 1 had a legacy adapter and a "synthetic". Synthetic is now standard and much faster - Gen 2 has no choices*
### VM States
VM states define what resources are being used
VM state can be
- Off
- Starting
- Running
- Paused
- Saved
### Manage Checkpoints

*Take up a lot of space*
### Import, Export and move VMs

*If you say you copied it, it will change the unique ID*
*If you say you moved it, it won't really change anything*
