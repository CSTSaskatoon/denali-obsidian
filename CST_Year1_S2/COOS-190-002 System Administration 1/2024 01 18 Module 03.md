# Implement enterprise storage solutions
## Overview
### What is DAS
Das is storage that physically attaches to the server
#### Advantages
- Simple to configure
- Inexpensive to implement
- Less Components
#### Disadvantages
- Server is a single point of failure
- Requires physical access to the server
### What is NAS
*Network Attached Storage* (*NAS*) is storage attached to a dedicated storage device and accessed through the network share (Not connected to a "Computer")
#### Advantages
- *Relatively inexpensive*
- Supports larger capacities than DAS
- Supports RAID
- Provides centralization storage for easy management
- Supports multiple operating systems
- Fairly simple to deploy
#### Disadvantages
- Relies on network throughput (?)
- Slower access times than with SAN (file level access) - just because it doesn't have as much redundancy
- Less reliable than SAN

### What is SAN
Storage Area Network (SAN) offers higher availability with the most flexibility
#### Advantages
- Provision of centralized storage pool
- Accessible from multiple operating systems
- *High throughput solution*
	- Block level access
	- Dedicated high speed network
- *Highly fault tolerant*
#### Disadvantages
- Required specialized skills
- *More expensive*
- Usually more complex
