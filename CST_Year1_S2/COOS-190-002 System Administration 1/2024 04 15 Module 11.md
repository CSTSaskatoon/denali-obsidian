# Maintaining and monitoring Windows Server Installations
### What is Windows Server Update Service (WSUS)
server role for managing update deployment
Can specify which updates to download
Can approve updates for a group test first
Use reporting to verify development
Computers must be configured to use the WSUS server for updates
### WSUS Server Deployment options
Simplest deployment is a single server that provides updates for all computers
A larger organization can have
- Multiple independent servers for geographic areas
- Replica mode hierarchy for centralized management
- Autonomous mode hierarchy for decentralized management

For isolated networks, you can use a disconnected WSUS server to deploy updates
### Update management Process
#### Phase 1: Assess - Set up production Environment
#### Phase 2: Identify - Discover new updates and determine if they are relevant
#### Phase 3: Evaluate and plan - Test updates, determine how to update production environment
#### Phase 4: Deploy - Approve and schedule updates, review process
### Server Requirements for WSUS
#### Software
Internet Information Services (IIS)
Microsoft `.NET` framework
Microsoft Report Viewer Redistributable
SQL Server or Windows Internal Database
#### Hardware
1.4 GHz x64 Processor
2 GB of RAM
10 GB of disk space (40 GB recommended)
### Configure Clients to use WSUS
Clients need to be configured to use WSUS
### WSUS Administration
can Manage updates, configure computer groups, and configure WSUS options/groups here
Monitoring
- Review computers status
- Review synchronization information

Configure and review WSUS reports
- Update Reports
- Computer Reports
- Synchronization Reports
### Computer Groups
Default computer groups include
- All computers
- Unassigned computers

Can create custom computer groups to control how updates are applied
Two ways to assign computers to a custom group
- Server-Side targeting - manually assign computers to a group you've created
- Client-Side targeting - Use group policy to add computers to a group (More common, automatic deployments, etc.)

*Can implement group hierarchy*
### Approve Updates
Updates can be
- Approved automatically (not recommended)
- Declined if they're not needed
- Removed if they cause problems
- Marked as superseded

Updates should be tested before they are approved for production

recommended best practice is
1. Test updates in lab environment
2. Test updates in pilot group
3. Update production environment
### Automatic Updates
Must configure the client computers to use WSUS server as the source for updates
Can use Group Policy to configure clients
- Updates frequency
- Enable client-side targeting
- Source Services for specific updates classes
### WSUS Troubleshooting
Clients not appearing in WSUS
- Check GPO and client settings

When WSUS server stops you should
- Check database server
- Reinstall WSUS

When you can't connect to WSUS you should
- Check network connectivity
- Telnet to HTTP and HTTPS ports

If you encounter other problems you should use
- Server diagnostics
- Client diagnostics
### WSUS Servers Video

Powershell DSC
- Helps to configure lots of machines with the same configurations
#### Push
Server pushes updates to all clients
#### Pull
idk
### PowerShell DSC
*Extension of windows PowerShell*
Extends Windows Management Framework
Enables management and maintenance of systems using declarative configurations

When planning to use DSC consider
- Relies on resources
- Can automatically reapply any deployed configurations
- Is scalable
- Doesn't require Computers belong to a ADDS domain
- Standards-based and is built around Open management infrastructure (OMI) model

#### Requirements for PowerShell DSC
Enables Windows Remote Management (WRM)
Configure the *Local Configuration Manager* on target computers
Install desired modules
Create and compile a configuration in PS Integrated Scripting Environment (PS ISE)
Deploy the configuration using push method
#### Implementing DSC
You create a DSC configuration as a `.ps1` file with 3 required elements
- *Configuration* identifies the file as a configuration file
- *Node* Identifies the computer or VM to which the configuration applies
- *Resource block* identifies the properties being configured

```PowerShell
Configuration ContosoDscConfiguration {
	Node "LON-SVR1" {
		WindowsFeature MyFeatureInstance {
			Ensure = "Present"
			Name = "RSAT"
		}
		WindowsFeature My2ndFeatureInstance {
			Ensure = "Present"
			Name = "Bitlocker"
		}
	}
}
```
#### Troubleshooting DSC
Use the Windows PowerShell DSC logs to troubleshoot issues
- *operational log* contains all error messages
- *analytical log* can identify where the errors occurred
- *debug log* helps you identify how the errors occurred

`xDscDiagnostics` for DSC diagnostics
- *`Get-xDscOperation`* finds the results of the DSC operations
- *`Trace-xDscOperation`* returns an object containing a collection of events, their event types, and the message output generated from a particular DSC operation
### Performance Monitor
Lets you review real-time performance data and saves log files
3 live views for tracking current activity - line graph, histogram graph, numerical report
Enables you to add and review objects, counters and instances
Can be managed by using PS
### Resource Monitor
Like task manager but more in depth
### Task Manager
Provides overview of processes, performance, users, details, services
Basically a Jack of all trades master of none for monitoring
Simple to use
### Event Viewer
### Server Manager
Can group servers by location or by services
### Terminology
Bottleneck - hardware/software component that impacts the computer's performance
Baseline - "normal"
