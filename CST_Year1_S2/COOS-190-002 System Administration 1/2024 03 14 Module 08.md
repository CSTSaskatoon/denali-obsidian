### Fault Tolerance
When a server goes down, it most likely adversely impacts revenue and productivity
If your network contains an external website/database downtime like this can be detrimental
If it's an internal server it might not allow users to perform their jobs
As a server admin you have to minimize downtime by identifying potential failures

*High availability* - Combination of technology, protocols, and redundant hardware that reduces the chance of disaster or failure
*Downtime* - periods of time when a system is unavailable
*Availability* - expressed as a percentage of uptime in a given year
Failover clustering is vital for high availability solution
### Prepare to implement failover clustering
Features of failover clustering
- High availability
- Stateful application
- IP-based protocols

Consider the following guidelines when planning node capacity in a failover cluster
- Distribute  the highly available applications form a failed node
- Ensure that each node has sufficient capacity
- Use hardware with similar capacity for all nodes in a cluster
- Only one node can have ownership of the shared storage at a time to make sure the data is consistent
- Shared storage usually formatted as NTFS or ReFS

*Basically anytime a user needs to have information stored/stay consistent over multiple sessions, you NEED clustering*
### Failover-Cluster Storage
Require shared storage to provide consistent data to a virtual server after failover
#### Shared Storage Options for Windows Server
Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)
- Lowest cost
- Not very flexible deployment
- Have limited number of connections for cluster nodes

Internal Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)
- Transmits SCSI commands over IP
- Not expensive because it doesn't require specialized network hardware
- Good performance

Fibre Channel

Can also implement clustered storage spaces to achieve high availability at the storage level
### Hardware Requirements
Make sure server hardware is certified for Windows Server
Server nodes should all have the same configuration and contain the same/similar components
Should all have the same configuration/components
Ensure all nodes have connection to the cluster storage
All servers must pass the tests in *Validate a Configuration Wizard*
Ensure each node runs on the same processor architecture
### Network Requirements
Network adapters must be identical, same IP protocol, speed, duplex and flow-control
Ensure you have no IP address conflicts and that they are reachable for nodes/storage/other cluster resources
Server should connect to multiple networks to ensure communication redundancy OR connect to a single network with redundant hardware
- This removes single points of failure

Sometimes you have to configure subnets for communication between clusters
- Confirm cluster nodes can exchange heartbeats over UDP 3343

Network adapters should be compatible with RSS and RDMA
- *Receive Side Scaling (RSS)* - implemented in network drivers that allows the distribution of network-receive processing across multiple CPUs
- *Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)* - Provides high throughput communication with minimum CPU usage

*PowerShell command to get the RSS*
```Powershell
Get-NetAdapterRSS -Name * | Format-List
```
*Another PowerShell Command*
```powershell
Get-SMBServerNetworkInterface
```
### Infrastructure/Software Requirements for a failover cluster
AD domain controllers should run on Windows Server 2016 or newer
Domain-functional level and forest-functional level should run on Windows Server 2012 or newer
DNS infrastructure must exist
Application must support Windows Server 2022 High Availability
Best software practices
- All nodes have the same edition of Windows Server and the same updates
### Security Considerations
Need a method of authentication and authorization
Unauthorized users should not have physical access
Antimalware software/other security solution
Intra-cluster communication authenticates with Kerberos V5
#### Windows Server 2022 cluster types
*Single-domain clusters* - cluster nodes are members of the same domain
*Workgroup Clusters* - Cluster nodes are not joined to the domain (workgroup servers)
*Multi-Domain Clusters* - Cluster nodes are members of different domains
*Workgroup and domain clusters* - cluster nodes are members of domains and members that aren't joined to the domain (workgroup)
### Quorum
*Defines how many cluster nodes are needed for the cluster to run*
![](Pasted%20image%2020240314141153.png)
*Dynamic Quorum* - Lets the cluster dynamically change how many nodes are required for the cluster to function so that it can stay up even when it doesn't meet Quorum
- Default Configuration
- Disk Witness - makes sure you always have majority vote
### Steps for Migrating/Updating Failover Clusters
1. Pause the cluster node and drain all the virtual machines (VMs) that run on the node
2. Migrate the VMs that run on the node to another node
3. Perform a clean installation of Windows Server 2022
4. Add back the node how running the Windows Server 2022 operating system (OS) to the cluster
5. Upgrade all nodes to Windows Server 2022
6. Use the Windows PowerShell cmdlet *`Update-ClusterFunctionallLevel`* to upgrade the cluster functional level to Windows Server 2022.
### Multi-Site/Stretched Clusters
Provides highly available clusters in more than one location
When a complete site fails, a stretched cluster can automatically fail over the clustered role to another site
Automated process reduces the possibility of Human error
Server 22 supports 2 types of stretched clusters - active-passive and active-active
Storage Replica technology synchronization
- Synchronous Replication - Bidirectional
- Asynchronous Replication - Not bidirectional
#### Advantages
Can automatically fail over the clustered role to another site
Automatically replicates to each node in a stretched cluster
- Don't need to deal with a cold standby server requiring manual replication

Reduces the possibility of human error in the manual process
### Validation Wizard
Performs tests such as 
- Cluster
- Inventory
- Network
- Storage
- System

MS supports a cluster solution only if the complete config passes all validation tests and all hardware is certified for Windows Server
When the validation is done you can get 3 indicators
- Green check mark (passed)
- Yellow yield sign (warning)
- Red circle with single bar (failed)

#### If using Event Viewer
Event Viewer - `Applications and Services\Microsoft\Windows`
### Configure Cluster
Don't evict a cluster unless you want to take it out permanently
