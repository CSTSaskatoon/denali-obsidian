# Storage Spaces
Storage spaces is essentially a better way to combine drives
In data center edition you have access to *Storage Spaces Direct* which lets you use drives on other servers and such
### Enterprise Storage Needs
When planning your storage, assess whether your storage solution meets the following needs
- Cost (One large drive vs many small ones)
- Performance (SSD vs HDD vs Tape, RAID)
- Capacity (How fast will it grow)
- High Availability (Fault Tolerance)
- Security (Physical location, Encryption)
### What is the storage spaces feature
Groups 3 or more disks into a storage pool
#### You can configure the storage spaces feature
On a windows PC
On a standalone server with all storage in a single server
On a clustered server using Storage Spaces Direct with local, direct attached storage (DAS) in each cluster node
On  a clustered server with one or more shared SCSI storage enclosures

#### Storage Spaces contains two components
Storage pools - A collection of physical disks aggregated into a logical disk so that you can manage multiple physical disks as a single disk
- You can use Storage Spaces to add physical disks of any type and size to a storage pool
- The pool itself cannot be used as a drive, you have to make storage spaces on it
Storage Spaces - Virtual disks created from free spaces in a storage pool
- Many functionalities are added that will be available to users and applications (Resiliencty level, Storage tiers, fixed provisioning, and management tools for administering storage)
#### System Requirements for Implementing Storage Spaces
Physical disk
- Minimum of 1
- Must be blank (no volumes/partitions)
Storage Pool
- A group of disks all treated like one big "physical" disk
Virtual disk
- These look like physical drives and are treated like them but are really just a space representing a drive (Like VHD but  a different format)
Disk Drive
- This is what we see with a drive letter and think of as a drive but is really just a space in a pool
#### Additional Features
Tiered Storage - A combination of faster and slower drives and frequently user data is stored on the faster drives
Write-back caching - When a server detects a peak in disk-writing activity, it automatically starts writing data to the faster disk
Persistent Memory (Pmem) - A cache to accelerate the active working set or as a capacity to guarantee consistent low latency on the order or microseconds
### Components and Features of Storage Spaces
![500](Pasted%20image%2020240129103704.png)
if you get a 4KB sector size drive, it can only use that 4KB sector size with other drives of the same size, otherwise 512e will step down to 512
### Changes to file and storage services in Windows Server 2022
- Storage Migration Service Improvements
- Adjustable Storage repair speed
- Faster repair and resynchronization after drive failure
- Storage bus cache with Storage Spaces on standalone servers
- ReFS file-level snapshots
### Usage Scenarios
Easily implement and manage scalable, reliable, and inexpensive storage
Use inexpensive storage with or without external storage
Combine multiple drives into storage pools that administrators can manage as a single entity
Implement different types of storage in the same pool (SATA, SCSI, SAS, USB)
Grow storage pools as required
Provision storage as required from existing storage pools
### Considerations
Storage spaces volumes aren't supported on boot or system volumes
You should add only drives that are unformatted or unpartitioned
A storage pool must include at least one drive
- Minimum of two drives for mirrored
- Minimum of five drives for 3-way mirroring
- Minimum of 3 drives for parity
All drives must use the same sector size
Storage layers that abstract the physical disks aren't compatible with Storage Spaces
- VHDs and pass through disks in a virtual machine 
- Storage subsystems that are deployed in a different RAID layer
Fibre Channel and iSCSI aren't supported
Failover clusters can use only SAS as a storage medium
### Manage Storage Spaces
Server Manager (Graphical)
- Create storage pools
- add, remove physical disks from pools
- Add, create, manage and delete VHDs
Windows PowerShell
Failover Cluster Manager
System Center Virtual Machine manager (SCVMM)
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
Advanced Management requires PowerShell
To enhance disk-fault tolerance
- Design a complete, fault-tolerant storage solution
- Deploy a highly available storage pool
- Verify hardware and firmware components
- Retain some unallocated space (if one of your disks starts expanding for some reason)
- Be prepared for multiple disk failures
- Provide fault tolerance at the enclosure level
#### PowerShell Commands

# Storage Spaces Demonstration
Primordial pool is the default pool server manager gives you, contains all of the disks that aren't being used in pools
- Cannot be used as a drive, only shows you which drives aren't being used
when selecting the disks to use in your new pool, you can choose to do automatic, manual or Hot Spare
### Creating a VHD in storage spaces
Enclosure Awareness - tries to match disks which are in the same enclosure together
Storage Layout - simple, mirrored, or parity
Provisioning - thin vs fixed
