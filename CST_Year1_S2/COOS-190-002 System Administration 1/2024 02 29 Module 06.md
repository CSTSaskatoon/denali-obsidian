# More Containers
### What are containers?
used for packaging an application with all it's dependencies and abstracting it from the host OS in which it's to run
#### Benefits of containers
Can run anywhere - local workstation, servers, cloud
Provide isolation
Efficient
consistent development environment
#### Function
Processor in a standard windows computer has two modes - user mode an kernel mode
When you install container technology on a container, each container makes an isolated environment from the host OS
each container has it's own copy of the user mode file systems, isolated from other containers and the host's own user mode environment
Each container is created from a container image
### VMs vs Containers
both are virtualization technologies that provide isolated and portable environments

VMs simulate an entire computer (includes virtualized hardware, OS, user mode, and it's own kernel mode)
Tend to be large and take up a lot of resources from the host
#### When to use a VM
Need to manage several OS
Need to run an app that requires all the resources and services of an OS
Need an environment that preserves changes and is consistent
Require complete isolation and security
#### When to use a Container
Need a lightweight application package that starts quickly
Need to deploy multiple instances of the same app
need to run an app or process that's non-persistent on an on-demand basis
Need to deploy an app that can run on any underlying infrastructure
### Isolation Modes for containers
Process Isolation (*Windows Server Containers*)
- Allows multiple container instances to run concurrently on a host. When running in this mode, the containers share the same kernel and host OS
- default configuration on Windows Server

Hyper-V Isolation (*Hyper-V Containers*)
- Each container runs inside a highly optimized VM
- each container gets it's own kernel
- More stability and security
- Hardware level separation for each container
- Starts up faster than a VM
- default configuration on workstations
### New features for containers in Windows Server 2022
Server core image size reduction
Longer support cycle for all windows container images
Virtualized time zone in containers
Scalability improvements for overlay networking support
gMSA improvements
Windows Admin Center Improvements
Azure Migrate App Containerization tooling
### Overview of Windows Server Containers
server deploye with Windows Server OS with a kernal mode and user mode
In user mode, the OS manages the container host (the PC that hosts containers)
Special stripped down version of Windows server creates containers
Windows container features only a user mode which lets windows processes and app processes to run in the container

### Hyper-V containers
Full guest OS with both kernel and user modes

### Usage Scenarios for Containers
#### Developers
Build and create high-quality apps faster
create a container image that deploys identically across all machines
#### IT professionals
Create infrastructure that is easier to update and maintain and that fully utilizes hardware resources
Provide standard environments for their development, QA and production teams
#### Windows Server Containers for
Hosting stateless apps
Rapid test deployment
Scenarios where apps and 0S are trusted
#### Hyper-V containers for
Scenarios where each container requires its own Windows OS kernel
Scenarios where you need memory assigned directly to the container
Independent lifecycle management
### Prepare Windows Server for running Containers
Use Windows Admin Center to install the *Container Feature* and *Container Extension*
Use Windows PowerShell to install *Docker Engine*
Use Windows Admin Center to setup *container environment*
#### Steps for setup
1. Install the container feature. 
2. Enable the Hyper-V role.
3. Enable nested virtualization. 
4. Configure virtual processors. 
5. Create a virtual switch.
6. Configure NAT settings.
7. Configure MAC address spoofing.
### Container Base Images
MS provides 4 base images that you can use as a starting point for building your custom image
Windows Image - All windows APIs, biggest
Windows Server image - same as Windows Image, but you can have server roles
Windows Server Core image - smaller, has some of the APIs, has the dotnet framework
Nano server image - Smallest, some server roles, some APIs
*Can get all of these from the Microsoft container registry* - `mcr Microsoft.com` in PS
### Docker
Docker provides functionality for apps in both the hybrid cloud and on-premises locations for both Windows and Linux environments
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)
Collection of open-source tools, solutions and cloud-based services
Can create, remove and manage containers

### Running a container on Windows Server
To create and deploy container image
- `docker run -it mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:ltsc2022 cmd.exe`  - *nanoserver*
- Alternatively, you can use Windows Admin Center
### Docker with Azure
