### How to configure SMB Shares
SMB Shares provide access to files on a remote server
Can be configured in many tools, like server manager, File Explorer, Windows Admin Center, and PowerShell
In Server Manager, you can create SMB shares by using one of the following profiles
- Quick
- Advanced
- Applications
In file explorer, you can configure additional share properties such as the number of users and caching
PowerShell includes the SmbShare module and can be used for configuring all share properties
New-SmbShare -Name Share1 -Path D:\\Folder1
### SMB Share Profiles
Quick - doesn't have any prerequisites and asks for basic config parameters
Advanced - Same options as Quick, and options such as folder owners, default data classification, and quotas
Applications - creates SMB share with settings for Hyper-V, databases, and other server applications. Unlike Quick and Advanced, you can't configure access-based enumeration, share caching, default data classification, or quota
