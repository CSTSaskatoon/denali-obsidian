# Social Engineering
- Art of convincing people to reveal confidential information
- Nontechnical attack
- Involves human interaction and often tricking people into breaking security procedures (con artist)
- Common part of many other attack vectors

## Stats
- Social engineering is used in over 97% of all attacks
- Phishing is the most common at 77% and almost 98% involve clicking a link
- 75x as many phishing sites as malware sites
- 43% of IT professionals say they have been targeted by social engineering in the last year

## Common Targets
- Receptionists
- Help Desk
- Technical Support Administrators
- System Administrators
- Users and Clients
- Vendors

## Why does it work?
- Trust
- Habits
- Fear
- Greed
- Moral Obligation
- Ignorance
- Lack of Training
- Unregulated access to the information
- Lack of security policies
- Multiple Organizational Units
- Difficult to detect
- No technology to rely on

## Impact
- Economic Loss
- Loss of privacy
- Blackmail/terrorism
- Lawsuits
- Loss of goodwill
- Temporary or permanent foreclosure

## Phases
- Footprinting - research, observe, phishing, dumpster diving, websites, company tours, talking with employees
- Select a victim - Specific person or small group
- Forge a relationship
- Exploit a relationship

## Human Based Attacks
- Pretending to be somebody such as
- Legit end user
- Important user
- Technical support
- Repairman
- Inspector
- Business partner
- Corporate representative
- Insider or utilize an insider

## Computer Based
- Phishing/Spear phishing
- Spam
- Instant Messaging
- Popup windows
- Packet sniffing
- Email interception

## Mobile Based
- Malicious Apps
- Repackaged legit apps
- Fake security apps
- SMS
  Malicious websites

## Social Media
- Prime target for social engineering
- Lots of small, seemingly unimportant pieces of information

### Information
- Photos
- Locations
- Friends and coworkers
- Social gatherings
- Likes and dislikes
- Dates of birth
- Family members names
- Equipment or policy changes
- Job designations
- Project details
- etc.

### Impersonation
- Create a fake profile on social media deigned to have something in common with the victim
- Gain trust as well as trust in friends
- Gather details
- Possibly gain access to employee groups where work details may be discussed
- Once enough information is gathered you can pretend to be that person, possibly even impersonating them on a different site

### Facebook
- Create a fake users group 'Employees of xxxx'
- Invite or friend people from the company
- Gather information
- Even ask questions of others
- With so many users/companies and groups on Facebook its hard to know what's legit

### LinkedIn and Twitter
- LinkedIn has a wealth of past history, preferences, personal hobbies and activities
- Twitter contains a lot of the minute information as well as responses to tweets that may be crafted to elicit specific responses

### Corporate use
- Data theft
- Data leaks
- Targeted attacks
- Vulnerabilities
- Spam and phishing
- Modification of contents
- Malware propagation
- Business reputation
- Infrastructure costs

## Attack Methods
- Pretending to be in need
- Pretending to be in authority
- Being angry - people don't want to anger you more
- Pretexting
- Piggy backing or tailgating
- Having lost keys, ID, etc.
- Phishing, spear phishing, vishing
- NLP (neuro linguistic programming)
- Drinks
- A person's car may have ID badges, keys, etc.

## Reverse Social Engineering
- Victim calls you
- Builds trust
- All problems are corrected, no suspicion may be raised
- You have control of the direction and content of the call
- Lots of pre-planning

### Phases
- Sabotage - Create the problem to begin with
- Advertising - pop up message?
- Assisting - help the person solve their problem

#### Sabotage
- Shouldn't be permanent or truly damaging
- Could be a configuration problem
- Nuisance program that pops u
- Renamed files
- TSR that hogs memory
- Hardware based (loose connection) though it might be difficult to get a username/password with this

#### Advertising
- Replace local posted numbers with yours
- Drop off a card in advance or phone call telling people you are the new tech number
- Can even show up in the 'error message' the user gets

## Countermeasures
- Education
- Effective policies
- Don't mix personal and business data or social media
- Verify contacts both in person and on social media
- Keep posted material to a minimum
- Good password policies
- Online profiles should be generic
- Monitor emails for spam and phishing
- Physical security
- Escort visitors
- Shred documents
- Separate duties
- Use least privileges
- Classification of information
- Operation guidelines
- Audits
- Change management

## Bottom Line
- There is no perfect defense against social engineering
- Only constant vigilance can stop SOME attacks
- Employee education is your best defense
