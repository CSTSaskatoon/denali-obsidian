# Attacks
## Malware
- Class of software designed to perform malicious and disruptive actions
- Major problem today
- Blanket term for various types of software actions
- Has become more disruptive and destructive
- Even if it's not destructive, they consume resources
- Newer versions are designed to stay healthy, evade detection, support criminal activity
- Stealing information has become more common

### THE LAW
- As the problem has changed so has the law
- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
- Patriot Act (Now the Freedom Act)
- CAN-SPAM Act
- Different states and countries have different laws

### Ways It Can Enter Your System
- Instant Messaging
- Removable devices
- Attachments via email (#1 cause)
- Browser bugs
- File Sharing (Network shares)
- Fake programs
- Legitimate programs (malicious updates)
- Downloads

### Categories
- Virus - Requires user action, attaches to another program/files, replicates
- Worm - Don't require user action, replicates very quickly, Often contains something else as the payload
- Spyware - Gathers information about user/system, often uses keyloggers
- Adware - Advertise product/service, May replace home pages, pop up ads, or install on a desktop
- Trojans - Social engineering to get started, don't replicate, usually requires human interaction
- Rootkit - Hide core components and disguise itself, difficult to detect and remove

#### Virus
- Self replicating app that attaches itself to other programs
- Alter Data
- Infect other programs
- Replicate
- Destroy data
- Corrupts hardware
- Changes form (polymorphic) - Helps prevent detection by antivirus since antivirus relies on unique hashes of virus code
- May encrypt itself (polymorphic)
- many other activities as well

##### Kinds
- System/Boot sector
- Macros
- Cluster
- Stealth or tunneling
- Encryption
- Cavity or File-overwrite
- Sparse-Infector
- Companion or Camouflage
- Logic bomb
- File or multipartite
- Shell
- Cryptovirus

##### Life Cycle
- Design
- Replication
- Launch
- Detection
- Incorporation
- Eliminate
- Repeat

##### Why
- Curiosity
- Hacktivism
- Ego
- Criminal Activity
- Pen Testing

##### How
- Create a `.bat` file
- `@echo off`
- `del C:\Windows\*.* /s /q /f`
- Use bat2com to convert to `.com`
- JPS Virus Maker - so you don't have to write the virus yourself

#### Worms
- Fully self replicating
- Don't require user interaction
- Don't require host application
- Replicates very fast
- Consumes bandwidth, memory and other resources
- Often carry a payload

#### Spyware
- Collect information

##### Infection methods
- Peer to Peer
- Instant messaging
- Emails
- Physical address
- Browser defects
- Websites
- Software installs (freeware)

#### Adware and Scareware
- Displays ads/messages on your system
- May change the start page of your browser
- Often associated with a web app

#### Ransomware
- Fairly new
- Encrypts files and requests payments to unencrypt
- May not actually unencrypt
- Rather than encrypting, may alter what is displayed on the screen until payment occurs

#### Trojans and Backdoors
- Covert access to a system
- Doesn't replicate
- Usually attached to another program

##### How they are used
- Delete or replace OS files
- Generate fake traffic
- Use victim machine for spamming
- Disable firewalls and AV

##### Types
- Banker
- DDoS
- Downloader
- Dropper
- FakeAV
- GameThief
- Instant Messaging
- Ransom
- SMS
- Spy
- Mailfinder
- Proxy
- Arcbomb
- Clicker
- Notifier

### Overt vs Covert Channels
- Overt is a legit and known path for sending info (Ex. HTTP and TCP/IP)
- Covert is a mostly used by trojans, need to get info in and out without being detected

## Sniffers
- Scan, capture and analyze packets
- Must be able to run NIC in promiscuous mode
- If packet is unaltered, considered passive
- Very useful in regular network maintenance

### Tools
- Wireshark
- Tcpdump and Windump
- Dsniff
- Ethercap
- MSN Sniffer

### Protocols
- Some protocols are less secure and easier to analyze
- Telnet, HTTP, SMPT, NNTP, POP, FTP, IMAP are unencrypted and easy to analyze
- All mail protocols are horrible

### Lawful Interception
- Used to be known as wire tapping
- What can be monitored and when is covered by law when in public
- Private networks have their own rules

### Wireshark
- Captures become very large very quickly
- Can filter by boolean operators (Ex. certain addresses, ports)

### Switched Networks
- Limits what you could see and capture
- Install software on server to see all traffic
- use port mirroring or Switch Port Analyzer port
- Mac flooding
- Arp Poisoning
- Mac Spoofing

### Defences Against
- Use switches
- Static ARP tables
- SSL
- IPSec
- VPNs
- Limit # of MACs a port can learn (port security)

## Session Hijacking
- Attacker intercepts and takes over legit, established session
- Can assume role of user or alter information being sent/received
- Can save info for later use
- TCP/IP very vulnerable if not encrypted

### Techniques
- Brute force an ID
- Steal an ID
- Calculate an ID
- Can occur at Network layer or Application layer of the OSI

### Spoofing vs Hijacking
- Spoofing the attacker pretends to be the original computer and may operate beside it

### Active vs Passive
- Active is sending data, manipulating the connection, using the connection later or in place of the original computer

### ID in Cookies
- Cookies can store a lot of information
- Accessible from other tabs (unlike URLs)
- Often persistent
- readable and writeable

### ID in the URL
- server isn't sure if the client supports cookies or not, so it generates a cookie and URL
- Will continue using the URL until the client uses the cookie
- Not visible by other tabs, but easier to find via sniffing

### Cross Domain Cookie Attack
- relies on the fact that wildcard cookies can be set by one subdomain that affects other subdomains
- Ex. website `www.example.com` hands subdomains out to untrusted parties
- Mallory now controls `evil.example.com`
- Visit to `evil.example.com` sets a cookie usable on `www.example.com`

### Session Fixation
- Attacker creates new session with proposed session ID
- Attacker sends link with established session ID to victim
- Victim clicks on the link sent from the attacker accessing the site
- Web server sees that a session was already established and a new one doesn't need to be created

### Application Session Hijacking
- Same concept as web based but using the application themselves
- May be local applications such as browsers
- May be the web servers or the applications generating session IDs
- Options are Session Sniffing, Predicting Session Tokens, Man in the middle, Man in the browser

### Cross Site Scripting
- Data from a trusted source contains dynamic content and malicious code can be associated with it
- Usually javascript but not always
- stored `XSS` is easiest
- Malicious code stored on the server as part of the 'page' the victim was viewing

#### Results
- Hijacking the browser
- Pseudo defacement of applications or site
- Scanning of internal host
- Delivery of content
- Exploitation of browser vulnerabilities

#### Reflected
- More complicate
- Malicious code is reflected or bounced off the server to represent error message or results of a request

### Cross Site Request Forgery
- Often providing a link

### Blind Hijacking
- Attacker can only capture traffic flowing in one direction
- Manipulating packets without seeing confirmation of results
- Predict sequence of numbers, etc.

### IP Spoofing
- Pretend to be the victim's computer
- Can also pretend to be the server
- Can be used for DoS

### DNS Spoofing and ARP Spoofing
- DNS Spoofing is pretending to be a DNS and sending the wrong IPs
- ARP Poisoning overwrites a victims ARP cache, can be used for man in the middle

### Desynchronizing a Connection
- Send NULL packets to server without victim knowing which increments sequence number without them knowing, kicking them off

### Network Session Hijacking
- TCP/IP Connections
- Can be DoS

### Session Hijacking Defense
- Encrypt network traffic
- Monitor network for strange ARP and DNS packets
- Have appliances (like gateway) check for and filter spoofed information
- Be aware of vulnerabilities and do things like clear caches
- Use strong authentication such as Kerberos
- Use defense in depth

## Web Services
- Usually meant to have many clients interacting simultaneously
- Web server itself probably has vulnerabilities
- Will often have a component on both server side and locally
- Will often interact with code located on server side

### Web Apps
- Three variations are Browser Based, Client Based, Mobile Apps
- All designed to gather and process information locally and then store on the server

#### Components
- Authentication Process (Anonymous, Basic, Digest, Integrated Windows, SSL)
- Web server (Hardware, software to process and deliver content)
- Session Tracking
- Permissions
- Application Content
- Data Access
- Data Storage
- Logic
- Logout
- Cookies
- All of these are potential attack vectors
- Web servers are exposed to the public

### Flawed Web Designs
- Exploit website code itself
- Comments
- Hidden tags
- Paths
- Server names
- File names
- Old pages
- Some data can be modified, especially if it's form based

### Buffer Overflow
- Writing more data to a buffer than it can hold
- Often crashes the program
- If it goes to the same spot in memory every time, it's exploitable because we can put malicious code where it overflows to

### Denial of Service (DoS)
- Consume system resources so it can't perform it's function
- Objective isn't to steal or expose confidential information
- Can be amplified by using multiple systems (DDoS)
- Examples are Ping, ICMP flooding, SYN flooding, account lockouts, etc.
- Ransomware is technically DoS

#### Defense Methods
- Flood timeouts - can be bypassed by using a distributed attack (Or I think spoofing your IP?)
- Reverse proxies
- Firewalls and Routers
- Load Balancers

### Banner Information
- Looking for something about your machine (Ex. What apache version do you use?)
- More ways to do this than just Banner Grabbing (Directory structure, sourcecode, etc.)

### Common Flaws and Attacks
- Vandalism or defacing a website
- Misconfiguration
- Input Validation
- Cross-site Scripting
- Un-validated redirects/forwards
- Insecure Logon systems

### Scripting Errors
- Improper coding
- Uploading bombs by allowing massive uploads to fill space
- Poison Null Byte Attack

### Session Management Issues
- Each session should have a different ID, encrypted with different key and use unique other parameters
- Long-lived sessions is when a session persists after it's finished being used (also cookies)
- Logout features should be provided
- Poor password change control
- Unprotected information in cookies

### Cookie Protection
- Secure
- HTTPOnly (JS can't use them)
- Domain
- Path
- Expires

### Directory Traversal
- Allows an attacker to move outside the web server to other parts of the server
- Weakness in ACL or root

### Testing Web Applications
- Burp Suite
- Vega Web Application Scanner - SQL Injection, XSS, Disclosure of sensitive information

### SQL Injection
- Old af
- Get information
- Insertion of characters into SQL query
- Insert misinformation
- Create information alter entries
- Escalate Privileges
- DoS
- Destruction of Data

#### Database Vulnerabilities
- Unused of forgotten ones
- Password cracking
- Unfiltered queries
- Informative error messages

#### Performing
- First find a target, can use Google for this
- Try to get error messages to find vulnerabilities
- Determine structure of tables
- Manipulate data

#### Blind Attack
- Not relying on error messages
- Time Consuming
- Ex. `if exists (select * from users) waitfor delay '0 :0 :10'`
- Checks if user exists
- If it can run the query, 10 second delay. If not, immediate return

#### Defense
- Use IDS
- Sanitize your inputs
- Avoid dynamic queries
- Keep software patched
- Harden the server
- Least privilege and proper user management
- Avoid default configurations and passwords
- Disable error messages

## Defenses
### Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Gather and analyze information coming through a network
- Spot violations/misuse
- Alerts admin once unusual activity is detected
- Packet sniffer at its core but has rules for what is normal and what isn't

#### Types
##### Network Based NIDS
- monitors traffic if it' moves through the network
- Signature Based - Compares traffic to known models
- Anomaly Detection (Heuristics) - what's normal for your network

##### Host Based
- Monitors one system
- Detect activity from local accounts
- Dealing with attacks on the host itself
- Unusual resource usage

##### Log File Monitors
- Search through log files
- Look for patterns of events that might indicate an attack

##### File Integrity Checks
- Monitors changes to the files themselves
- Can be as simple as size and time stamps that can be easily fooled
- Often uses hashes and checksums
- Can usually recognize some files will change but rapid file changes are unusual
- Similar to host based but only watches files

### Firewalls
- Barrier between two zones of areas or trust
- Can be software or hardware
- Choke point
- Form of IDS as traffic is monitored and logged
- Typically only allow certain traffic through
- Use rules to determine how traffic is handled
- Rules for inbound and outbound
- Usually will act like a router
- Usually has notification abilities

#### Terminology
- Bastion Host - Exposed fully to the public, unprotected
- Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - Screened subnet, semi-protected
- Screened Subnets
- Multihomed Firewalls - separate your network
- Back to Back Firewalls (make sure they are different)

#### Types
- Packet Filtering - Looks at every packet, simple allow/deny
- Stateful inspection or dynamic packet filtering - just looks at the first few packets of the conversation (good for things like voip that need high throughput)
- Circuit Level - only looks at handshaking of requested session, not packets after
- Application Level - Looks at the data itself (Ex. Web traffic, mail, is it malicious data?)

#### Determining the Type
- Port scans can reveal the type
- Banner grabbing with Telnet
- Firewalking is finding the ACL

### Honeypots
- attract attacker away from main system
- Can be decoys or for research
- Not designed for any specific vulnerability
- Made to look like a legit, high value system

#### High vs low interaction
- Low interaction emulate a single service/program and used to detect an attack on a specific system
- High interaction are more complex, not an emulation but real system
- Entire network is called a honeynet

## Evasion
- How can An attacker get around your defenses?
- DoS attacks make the IDS malfunction or become unreliable
- Insertion attack sends packets to a legit system inside to get by the IDS but the packets are modified to be malicious
- Obfuscation attacks obscure the packets so the IDS doesn't recognize them but the end system does
