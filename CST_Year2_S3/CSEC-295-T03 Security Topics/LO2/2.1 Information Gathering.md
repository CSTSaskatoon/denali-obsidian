# Information Gathering
## Terminology
- **Passive**/**Open Source** Gathering - Obtain information from public resources such as social media, blogs, discussion groups, press releases
- **Active** Gathering - Engaging the target
- **Pseudonymous** - Information on target that is posted under a different name

## Footprinting
- Sometimes called **Reconnaissance**
- Collect information
- Almost always passive
- About gathering information to formulate a strategy
- Can use public searches like Whois and DNS
- Domain Names, E-mails, web sites, web application, etc.
- Find the security posture
- Who are partners and clients that might provide vulnerabilities
- Alarm systems and IDS
- Network information
- Operating Systems
- Organization Information

### Network Information
- Domain names for all aspects of the business
- Internal domain names
- IP Addresses
- Websites used for testing or other non-advertised purposes
- Private websites such as logon pages
- 'Rogue' websites such as development ones
- Services being used
- Access control mechanisms (Firewalls, VPNs, Remote Access Servers)
- IDS/IPS
- Phone numbers
- VOIP services
- E-mails
- Authentication mechanisms (smart cards, tokens, etc.)

### Operating Systems
- Types and version
- System names
- User and group information
- Remote Systems
- Control Systems

### Organizational Information
- Location
- Company Directory (Entra/AD DS/LDAP)
- Website
- Employee details
- Comments in HTML code
- Script
- News articles and press releases
- Links relevant to the organization

### Threats introduced by Footprinting
- Social engineering
- Network and system attacks
- Information leaks
- Privacy loss
- Revenue loss

### Process
- Search engines, some are specialized - `Shodan.io` and `Filedigg.com`
- Google hacking (Dorking)
- `Cache:<website>` can reveal older information
- `Link:<website>`
- `Info:<website>` - show info about the site
- `Archive.org`
- Netcraft is a suite of tools
- Link Extractor pulls internal and external links from a site

### Location and Geography
- Physical location and details can be useful for social engineering as well as physical vulnerability testing
- Google Earth
- Google maps and street view
- Webcams
- Public Record searches

### Social Media
- Huge source of up to date information
- Even posts that seem to not contain much can be combined to reveal a lot
- Using information from various sources can gain even more details
- Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Company site (job postings, Bios)
- Some search engines can notify you of changes which can allow you to spot mistaken posts before they are removed

### E-mails
- Lots of information
- Tools - PoliteMail, WhoReadMe
- Tools to help with phishing as well

### Competitive Analysis
- Public information on a company that must be released for legal purposes
- EDGAR has reports on publicly traded companies
- LexisNexis has legal news and press releases
- BusinessWire and CNBC cover financial news

### Network Information
- Whois
- Ping
- NSLookup
- Tracert
- DNS zone transfers
- All can be used to find bits of the puzzle

### Social Engineering
- Eavesdropping
- Phishing
- Shoulder Surfing
- Dumpster Diving
- Observation

## Scanning
- Engaging and probing the target
- Active
- Based on information gathered from footprinting
- Map the network and get an understanding on what is there and how it works together

### Types of Scans
- Port Scan
- Network Scan
- Vulnerability Scan

#### Full Open Scan
- Full completion of 3 way handshake
- Open port returns SYN and ACK
- Closed port returns RST
- Easily seen and logged

#### Half-Open Scan
- Also called SYN scan or stealth scan
- Less likely to be noticed
- Last 3 steps of 3 way handshake (the ACK) is never sent

#### Xmas Tree scan
- based on the flags being set to on inside the packet
- has URG, PSH and FIN flags on
- Invalid combination on many systems to gets dropped

#### FIN Scan
- Similar to Xmas tree scan but only FIN flag is set
- Dropped by open ports and RST from closed ports
- Less likely to be noticed as it's closing a session
- Easier to pass through firewalls

#### Idle Scan
- Very stealthy
- Hides attackers identity by bouncing packets of another machine first
- More difficult to do
- Need to find a zombie machine
- Zombie needs to be idle or not sending out packets
- based on the zombie's IP ID

#### ACK Scan
- Most of these can be blocked by a stateful packet inspecting firewall
- Test for the presence of these firewalls

#### UDP Scan
- No flags
- If the port is open, doesn't return anything

#### Countermeasures
- Firewall and IDS
- Block ICMP Echos (ping)
- Filter ICMP Messages
- Block ports on the firewalls
- Update and patch firewalls, routers and IDSs

#### IDS Evasion
- Spoof your IP
- Use source routing
- Connect to a proxy server
- Use fragmented IP packets

#### OS Fingerprinting
- Can be passive and just use the packets received from sniffing
- Can be active and use specially crafted packets
- Looking in differences that each OS puts in packets
- Can look at file extension (`.aspx` used in IIS, 3 letter extensions usually Windows)
- Folder structure
- File names
- Settings

#### Active OS Scan
- Try a variety of different packet types and analyze the results
- `nmap`

#### Banner Grabbing
- Banner is what a service returns to a requesting program
- Several tools such as Telnet, Netcraft, Xprobe and P0f

#### Vulnerability Scan
- Find if there is a possibility of being attacked and what needs to be fixed
- Usually done with a utility
- Only look for known vulnerabilities
- Nessus, OpenVas, etc.

#### Mapping a network
- Picture of target environment
- Intermapper

### Types of Information
- Live hosts
- Open/closed ports on each host
- O/S and System architecture
- Services and processes running on host
- Type and severity of vulnerabilities
- Patch levels
- Firewalls
- Addresses of routers and other devices

### Live Systems
- Wardialing - sit there and dial phone numbers
- Wardriving - drive down a street with a laptop and get a map of all the access points in the neighborhood, can also use drones
- Pinging
- Port Scanning

### Proxies
- System between scanner and target
- Some anonymity for the attacker
- Available for use without installing anything, go to a website or change browser settings
- VPN or TOR could be used as well
- NAT may be similar but doesn't anonymize
- Proxy chain is using several proxies

### Anonymizing
- Proxies
- Use a live cd OS
- Clean cookies with something like G-zapper
- Spoof your IP (won't get return traffic)

### Countermeasures
- Encryption
- Multiple firewalls
- Don't use IP based authentication
- Random initial sequence numbers
- Ingress filters
- Egress filters

## Enumeration
- Extracting information to determine more of the configuration
- usernames, machine names, shares, services, routing tables, group names, account types, password files
- Active so higher risk of being noticed
- Extracting information from e-mail IDs
- Use of default password
- Using brute force attacks on directory services
- Exploiting SNMP
- Exploiting SMTP
- DNS zone transfers
- Capturing user groups
- Retrieving system policy settings

### Enumerating in Windows
#### Users
- Guest - limited access, disabled by default
- Administrator - Not enabled by default anymore. User account created with same privilege but doesn't run everything in privileged mode
- Local service
- Network Service
- System
- Current User

#### Groups
- Anonymous logon
- Creator group
- Interactive
- Network
- Service
- Administrator
- Terminal Server User

#### System Identifier (SID)
- How everything in Windows is identified
- Users always start with `S-1-5-21`
- Administrator always ends with `500`
- Guest always ends in `501`
- `S-1-5-18` is System account
- All stored in System Account Manager (SAM) on local machines

#### Tools
- Hyena
- Superscan
- Winfingerprint
- PsInfo
- PsList
- Net View
- Getting a copy of the SAM

### Enumerating in Linux
- Users stored in `/etc/passwd` - specific format
- UID under 100 is usually system
- UID over 500 is usually User

#### Exploits
##### NetBIOS
- Intended to assist in accessing services on local machine such as shares, printers, user and group info

##### NULL Sessions
- connections made without credentials
- Designed for one system connection to another to do enumeration
- Only connects through IPC Share
- Gives a list of users, groups, machines, shares and SIDs
- Many tools that will gather information through this

### DNS Zone transfers
- Zone contains names and IP assignments for all machines and servers
- MX records indicate mail server
- SRV records indicate your DCs and other infrastructure machines
- DNS transfer is often restricted on modern machines but may be available or able to be spoofed

### Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
- Used by most modern infrastructure (routes, switches)
- Consist of the agent, management station and Management Information Base (MIB)
- Usually contains 2 passwords, a read (public) and a read/write (private) but many places leave them as default
- Can be monitored with tools like Engineer's Toolset, SNMP Scanner or OpUtils

### Network Time Protocol (NTP) Enumeration
- If you can change the time of machines, authentication and other things will break
- Commonly overlooked
- `Ntptrace` will determine where the NTP server gets it's time and follow the chain of NTP servers
- `Ntpq` can list all host addresses
- `Nmap` can be used to query which machines have connected in the past
- More tools are `NTP Server Scanner`, `NTPQuery`, `LAN Time Analyzer`, `Wireshark`

### Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Enumeration
- Sends e-mail messages between servers
- Use Telnet to send commands through open ports
- `VRFY` can check if a specific ID is present
- `EXPN` can return all users in a distribution list
- `RCPT TO` can send message to multiple people
- Tools to automate such as `NetScanTool`, `SMTP Email Generator`, `SMTP-User-Enum`

#### Attacks
- SMTP Relay lets users send emails through an external users, helps spammers

## System Hacking
- Privilege Escalation is making a regular account (less defended) have better access
- Horizontal Escalation is when you take over the user of a different but equal level account
- Vertical Escalation is when you take over the use of a higher level account
### Password Cracking
- Non Electronic - Shoulder surfing, Dumpster diving, Social engineering
- Passive Online - Packet sniffing, man in the middle, Replay

### Techniques
- Dictionary
- Brute Force
- Hybrid
- Rule Based
- Hash injection and birthday attacks
- Spyware/keyloggers
- Default passwords
- USB Drive theft
- Rainbow Attacks
- Distributed Networks Attack (DNA)

### Privilege Escalation
- DLL hijacking is when you place a malicious DLL where the application will execute it first
- Common location for DLL hijacking is in the same directory as the app
- Having a command prompt start with system resources

### Executing Applications
- Backdoors/Trojans

### Keyloggers
#### Hardware Based
- BIOS Embedded
- Keyboard embedded
- External (USB, Acoustic or Camera, Bluetooth, WiFi)

#### Software Based
- Application
- Kernel/Rootkit/Device Driver
- Easier to find but easier to set up

### Data Hiding
- Less common locations
- NTFS Data Streams
- Steganography (Images, whitespace in documents, Folders, Videos, audio files)
- Script and Code

## Covering your Tracks
- Delete log files (manually or CCleaner)
- Disable auditing
- Remove Most Recently Used (MRU) tracking
- Be sure accounts you create follow the naming structure
