# Internet of Things (IoT)
- Network of physical devices
- Embedded with electronics which enables them to connect and exchange data
- Concept of connecting any device with an on/off switch to the internet and each other
- Concept wasn't named until 1999, but first internet appliance was a coke machine at Carnegie Melon University in 1982

## Why is it popular
- Costs are low
- Gadgets are simple to install
- Solve nagging problems
- Biggest opportunities lie in designing better user experiences

## Security Issues
- Fundamental weakness is devices are no longer behind firewalls
- Collect a lot of data

## Big Data
- Data Anonymity
- Even de-identified data doesn't necessarily remove privacy risks
- Organizations that want to anonymize data to then use it for other purposes will find it difficult
- Will soon become almost impossible to effectively anonymize data
- Your data gets brokered

### Security Concerns
- New technology that isn't super well understood
- Implementations typically include open source code
- Attack surface of nodes in a cluster may not have been reviewed, server not hardened enough
- User authentication and access from multiple locations may not be restricted enough
- Regulatory requirements may not be fulfilled with access logs
- Admins may decide to mine data without permission or notification
- Data is too big for routine security audits
- If owner doesn't regularly update security there is a risk of data loss or exposure
- Real time security monitoring is intended to alert the organization of an attack as soon as possible
- Few organizations have the resources to analyze the feedback and analysis
- **auto-tiering** is a storage method where items are assigned a level of storage based on policies
- Data is moved automatically, rarely accessed, but critical information could end up on a low tier
- *how do you analyze data while protecting information?*

## Attack Methods
- Insecure Web App
- Insecure Authentication/Authorization
- Insecure Network Services
- Lack of Transport Encryption
- Privacy Concerns
- Insecure Cloud Interface
- Insecure Mobile Interface
- Insufficient Security Configuration
- Insecure Software/Firmware
- Poor Physical Security
