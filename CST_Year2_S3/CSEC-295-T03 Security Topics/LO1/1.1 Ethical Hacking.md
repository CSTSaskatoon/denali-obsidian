# Ethical Hacking
- Also called "**Penetration Testing**"
- A security expert thinks differently
- Article "The twisted mind of a security expert"

## What is Ethics
- Moral principles that govern a person's behaviour
- Concerned with what is good for individuals and society
- "Good" and "Bad"
- Placing a "value" on acts
- Will this be consistent from society to society and person to person?
- Issue of rights and responsibilities of individuals on the internet is complex because the internet that supports the web is worldwide

## Computer Ethics
- Similar to regular ethics
- Application of computing technology raises intriguing conceptual issues and serious ethical problems
- Happens frequently because computers are logically malleable and can be configured to perform old tasks in new ways and to accomplish new tasks
- Computers rapidly store and search vast amounts of information, privacy has been an ongoing concern of computer ethics
- Property is a major issue because digital information can be copied so easily and accurately, the extent to which digital products should be owned and protected is heavily debated
- Computers can create and shift relationships of power, allows individuals to perform complex tasks easily
- Issue of rights and responsibilities of individuals on the internet is complex because the internet that supports the web is worldwide
- Security is the fundamental problem on the internet

## What is Ethical Hacking
- Act of **consensually** locating weaknesses and vulnerabilities of computer and information systems by **duplicating the intent and actions** of **malicious hackers**
- Ethical Hacker is computer and networking expert who systematically attempts to penetrate a computer system or network on behalf of it's owners for the purpose of **finding security vulnerabilities**
- **Employed** to test the security of a company
- Use the same skills and tactics as a regular hacker but with **permission**
- Don't reveal weaknesses they find with anyone outside of the company
- Have a contact that stipulates what is off-limits
- Do no harm

## Responsibilities of an Ethical Hacker
- Get proper permission
- Only test what has been stipulated
- Maintain confidentiality (Weaknesses and any information gathered)

## Code of Conduct
- Created by the EC Council
- Needed to remain certified
- Keep information gained private and confidential
- Protect the intellectual property of others
- Disclose to the appropriate person/authorities potential dangers
- Provide service in the areas you are competent in, be honest about your limitations and abilities
- Never knowingly use software or a process obtained illegally
- Never engage in deceptive financial practices
- Use the property of client only in  away properly authorized with consent
- Add to the knowledge of the community by continued study
- Do not associate with malicious hackers or engage in malicious activities
- Do not compromise or cause to be compromised on the client's system
- Ensure all testing is authorized
- Do not take part in or be a member of black hat activities or communities
- Do not be in violation of any laws or have any previous convictions

## Penetration Testing
- Ethical Hacking
- Authorized attack on a computer system to evaluate security
- Doesn't stop at uncovering vulnerabilities - goes the next step to actively exploit the vulnerabilities in order to prove/disprove attack vectors against an organization's IT assets, data, humans, and/or physical security

### Why Do a Pen Test
- Every business needs to know their **security posture** (How good your security is)
- Determining the feasibility of a particular set of attack vectors
- Identifying higher-risk vulnerabilities that result from a combination of lower-risk vulnerabilities
- Identifying vulnerabilities that may be difficult or impossible to detect with automated network/application vulnerability scanning software
- Assessing magnitude of potential business and operational impacts of successful attacks
- Testing the ability of network defenders to successfully detect and respond to attacks it can't stop
- Providing evidence to support increased investments in security personnel and technology to upper-level management, investors and customers
- Meeting compliance - Ex. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- Post security incident, organization needs to determine the vectors used to gain access
- Combined with forensics, often used to re-create the attack

### Definitions
- **Hack Value** - Target may attract above-average levels of interest from attackers
- **Target of Evaluation** (TOE) - System being evaluated for vulnerabilities
- **Attack** - Actively engaging a TOE
- **Zero Day** - vulnerability unknown to developers that has not been addressed
- **Security**
- **Threat** - Potential Violation of security
- **Vulnerability** - weakness in a system that could be exploited
- **Exploit** - Using a vulnerability to attack a system
- **Daisy Chaining**

### Goals
- A secure system is a difficult system to work with (Security vs Convenience)
- Gather requested information
- If security controls are modified, ensure they do not adversely affect usability
- Test new/changed security controls

### Types of Testing
- **Black Box** - little/no knowledge of the system, a real attacker
- **Gray Box** - Limited knowledge of the system
- **White Box**

## IT Audit
- Process used to evaluate and confirm the current controls protecting an organization
- Preserve the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- **Non-repudiation** - person can't deny the actions taken
- **Authenticity** - Data has come from a legitimate and identifiable source

## Hacking Methodologies
- **Footprinting** - passive tools to gain information (Ex. googling a person's name)
- **Scanning** - Use information gathered from above and use it to focus on non-invasive but active gathering techniques (Ex. Trying to log in with a wrong password)
- **Enumeration** - Extracting much more detailed information from the scanning to see if it's usable, should be raising red flags
- **System Hacking** - Use information gathered to plan and execute a plan
- **Escalation of Privilege** - Elevate your access to allow you to access more privileged information
- **Horizontal Escalation** - Don't have any higher access, but have access to more things at the same level (Ex. gaining access to multiple departments in the organization)
- **Covering Tracks** - Remove evidence of your presence
- **Planting Backdoors** - Leave behind something that enables you to re-enter the system later
- Before starting, determine your goal by asking the client questions, determine boundaries/scope/stipulations, what will determine a success

## Ethics and the Law
- Not knowing it is not an excuse
- Laws vary between countries and regions
- May be laws based on religion as well
- Technology is ever-changing
- Laws aren't clear as to who polices what online
- Technology is developing so quickly that is hard for the legal system to keep up

## Commandments
- Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people
- Thou shalt not interfere with other people's computer work
- Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files
- Thou shalt not use a computer to steal
- Bunch of other ones I'm too lazy to copy
