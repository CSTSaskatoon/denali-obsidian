# Mobile And Wireless
## Wi-Fi
- Attack can take less than 2 seconds
- More than half of all open wifi networks are susceptible to abuse
- Shared media so decreased throughput
- Eavesdropping is easy
- More interference
- Lower distance
- More terrain and building dependent
- Easy to cover large areas
- Not tied to one spot
- Really cheap

### Terminology
![](Pasted%20image%2020250516083453.png)

### Antennas
- Type affects performance
- Dipole or omnidirectional
- Directional ones are Yagi, Parabolic, Cantenna, Shaped

### Types of Wireless Networks
- Extension to existing network (can be software or hardware based)
- Multiple access points that overlap and either connect to wired network or act as relay (Mesh network)
- LAN to LAN where APs are interconnecting from one LAN to another
- 3G/4G hotspot provides access to wifi enabling devices using cellular towers

### SSID
- Service Set Identifier
- Used to identify and locate an AP(s)
- Continuously broadcasted
- text string up to 32 characters
- Embedded in packet header
- Can be hidden but still usable by known clients and found by someone trying

### Authentication Modes
- Open System Authentication - no password, client sends authentication packet with the SSID and then can communicate
- Shared Key Authentication - client sends auth request, AP returns challenge, Client encrypts challenge with key, AP uses the key to decrypt challenge
- Neither address data encryption

### Wireless Encryption Methods
#### WEP
- Weakest but still used
- Designed to prevent eavesdropping and verify integrity
- Developed without public consultation or cryptologists
- Keys are difficult to implement or change on a large scale
- Keys can be guessed by examining packets
- IVs are only 24 bits so very limited in being unique

##### Cracking
- All packets are encrypted with the same key
- Gather enough packets to analyze IV portion

#### WPA
- Meant to be a software upgrade for WEP
- Uses Temporal Key Integration Protocol (TKIP)
- Works as wrapper for WEP
- Uses original WEP programming but wraps with additional code at beginning and end
- Encrypts each data packet with unique key

#### WPA2
- Better encryption using AES and CCMP

#### WPA2 Enterprise (802.1x)
- Uses EAP and RADIUS

#### 802.11i
- Network authentication BEFORE entering
- Designed more for corporate networks

#### WPA3
- 192 bit encryption that was different for each user

#### Additional WPA Algorithms
- Cryptographic message integrity check to protect packets
- IV sequencing mechanism

#### WPA Weaknesses
- Weak initial key chosen by user
- Packet spoofing
- DoS
- Issues with auth
- Keys can still be figured out if you capture the initial key exchange enough times

### Threats
- War Driving and War Chalking
- Rogue Access Points - Creates unsecure connection to network
- MAC Spoofing to get around MAC filtering
- AD Hoc Association - made to look like corporate or public network, may connect to unsuspecting host, most users can't tell the difference
- AP Misconfiguration - not enabling proper security or leaving defaults
- Client mis-association
- Promiscuous client
- Jamming
- Honeypot
- Confidentiality attacks (eavesdropping, traffic analysis, cracking WEP, Evil twin AP, MITM, Masquerading, Session hijacking, Honeypots)
- Integrity attacks (Data frame injection, WEP injection, Data replay, IV replay, Bit flipping, EAP replay, RADIUS replay, Virus)
- Availability attacks (AP theft, DoS, Beacon flood, Authentication flood, Disassociation flood, De-authentication flood, TKIP MIC flood, ARP poisoning, EAP failure, Routing attacks, Power Saving attacks)

### Discovery
- Scan for networks as you travel
- Various websites list known APs
- Word of mouth
- Drone
- Use of better antennas can allow you to cover more distance easily

### Traffic Analysis
- Monitor traffic with something like Wireshark
- Look for known vulnerabilities in the type of Ap
- The SSID
- If there are multiple AP
- Authentication methods
- Encryption algorithms
- Channels

### Launching the Attack
- Find the SSID
- Fragmentation attack - obtain some of the key material (not the key itself) and forge packets with it for injection
- Disassociation and deauthenticaiton attacks, etc.

## Bluetooth
- Intended to be short range, low bandwidth to create a personal area network
- Has discoverable, limited discoverable and non-discoverable modes
- Can be in pairing mode or non-pairing mode
- While short range, some can work at 1000m+

### Threats
- Leaked calendar and address book information
- Bugged devices
- Remote control of device to make phone calls, etc.
- Some worms can transmit through bluetooth
- Social engineering
- Sending SMS messages

### Hacking
- Bluesmacking - old, send packet of wrong size and bluetooth has a siezure 'ping of death'
- Bluedebugging
- Blueprinting
- Mac Spoofing
- MITM

## Mobile Computing
- More and more people are using mobile devices
- Manufacturers tend to lean towards features rather than security
- Opened security holes

### Risks
- From OWASP
- Improper Platform Use (Ex. Android intents, platform permissions, etc.)
- Insecure data storage
- Insecure communication
- Insecure Authentication/Authorization
- Insecure Cryptography/encryption
- Client code quality
- Code tampering
- Extraneous Functions (Ex. flashlight app asking for your camera)
- Session Handling
- Physical security

### Attacks
- Phishing
- Framing
- Clickjacking
- Drive by downloads
- Man in the Mobile
- Buffer Overflow
- Data caching
- Generally things don't work as well on mobile

### SMS Based Attacks
- Baseband
- SMiShing
- Radio Frequency

### Application Based Attacks
- Data storage
- Poor encryption
- Improper SSL validation
- Configuration manipulation
- Dynamic runtime injection
- Unintended permissions
- Escalation of privileges

### OS Based Attacks
- No passcode
- Jailbreaking/rooting
- Poor encryption algorithms
- Carrier loaded software
- Zero day exploits
- Viruses and Trojans
- Lack of updates on both OS and Apps
- Variety of android systems (good and bad)

### Network Based Attacks
- Unsecure wifi
- Bunch of other shit

### Device Security Models
- Access control is utilized such as password, biometrics, least privileges, sandboxxing
- Digital signatures are becoming more popular
- Encryption is more available

### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
- Becoming very popular
- People are mixing personal and corporate data
- You don't know what they are doing the phone
- Data may be unsecure (Software and physically)
- Improper disposal (Ex. if you are trading your phone in)
- Often require installation of management software

#### Security Guidelines
- Restrict application
- Only install apps from trusted source
- Enable remote wiping
- Don't use wifi and bluetooth at the same time
- enforce password policies

#### Attack Methods
- Root the phone
- Perform DoS
- Check browser for vulnerabilities
- Check for SQlite vulnerabilities
- Look for compatibility leaks
