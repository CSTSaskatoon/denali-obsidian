# Sites and Replication
## Replication
- Because DCs are multi-master, they both have read/write copies of the database
- These changes have to be replicated to every DC
- Normally we don't have any control over it, it just happens
- Instead, we can create sites to manage the replication

### AD DS Partitions
- represent contiguous parts of AD DS hierarchy
- Designate replication scope
- Global Catalog DCs are another type of replication scope (portion of the domain partition, knows stuff like the members of universal groups), every DC has the same Global Catalog
- **Configuration** and **Schema** are replicated to every DC in every domain
- Domain and Application are only replicated in their specific domain

### Characteristics
- Multi-master replication
- Pull Replication - Change notification/request, Urgent Replication
- Store and forward replication
- Automatic generation and updates of replication topology
- Attribute-level and linked value replication
- Types are **Intrasite** (within a site, automatic) and **Intersite** (between sites, configurable)
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Can have different topology for different parts of the partitions???

#### Change Notification/Request
- Always has a 15 second delay somewhere? (Can configure it to be different for intersite)
- On one of the DCs you connect and modify the directory (Ex. create/modify a user)
- AD forms **connection objects** which are one-way connections
- Forms a 'ring-like' topology between all the replicated DCs
- DC that you made the changes on sends  *change notification* to it's partner (the next one in the ring)
- DC that you sent the notification to sends back a *change request*
- Original DC you made the changes on sends it to the other one it's connected to in the ring, notification, blah blah blah
- Now the updated DCs send change notifications and shit to the next DCs in the ring

#### Urgent Replication
- Sends the notification out lot faster
- Examples are Account lockout and Password changes

#### Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC)
- Automatically creates and manages replication topology
- Can create new **Connection objects** so it's more like a mesh than a ring if it finds it will take too long to replicate changes to all DCs
- Polls every domain controller every hour to see if it's still there (if not, it's removed from the topology)

### Replication Conflicts
- Concurrent writes to the same attribute of matching objects on two DCs
- Creating or modifying an object in a container deleted on another DC
- Creating two objects with the same distinguished name on two DCs
- Resolution is **automatic**
- For attribute conflicts, examines the version number of modified attributes (Update Sequence Number (USN)), timestamps of changes and GUID of originating DCs (Most updated/Last modified wins)
- For deleted containers, object is moved to **LostAndFound**
- For duplicate objects, one of them is renamed with *CNF* prefix (Ex. Bob and CNFBob are created)

### `SYSVOL` Replication
- Uses topology and schedule managed by KCC
- Replicates `SYSVOL` shared folder hierarchy
- Supports DFS-R (Current, supporting RDC) and FRS (legacy, not supported starting with Windows Server 1709) replication protocols
- Use Computer Management to get a list of file shares

## Sites
- Represent individual **locations**
- Were original meant to deal with slow internet
- Now we mostly use it to **control the flow of replication traffic**, **localized access** to AD DS services and location-based **Group Policy scope**
- Rely on **subnet objects** to map to underlying network infrastructure
- Include automatically generated `Default-First-Site-Name` site
- Also good for Cloud Infrastructure
- Managed in Active Directory Sites and Services

### Why Have multiple Sites
- Low-bandwidth, high-latency, unreliable connections between locations
- Separate physical location, large number of users
- Need to control frequency or scheduling of replication traffic
- Localization of services (Ex. Saskatoon users shouldn't be able to see Regina printers)

### Replication Between Sites
- Intersite, utilizes network limits
- Spanning tree topology
- Compression support, about 10 - 15%
- Site link - Based control of topology, schedule, frequency

### Intersite Topology Generator (ISTG)
- Component of KCC
- Hosted by single DC in each site
- Identifies **bridgehead servers** in local site
- Might have the option to specify list of preferred bridgehead servers - In this case, ISTG will no longer automatically generate bridgehead servers. If the preferred one goes down, **your site-site replication WILL BREAK**

#### Bridgehead Servers
- Automatically configured by ISTG (unless you set up a preferred one)
- Retrieves list of DCs in local site
- Identifies directory partitions on DC hosts
- Designates bridgehead servers (DC to host connection objects required to replicate each directory partition with bridgehead servers in other sites)
- **Basically, just the DC that communicates between the sites**

### SRV Records
- Used by AD DS to advertise the **location of it's services**
- Include information about service name and port (Ex. LDAP port 3389), Protocol (UDP and TCP)

### How Domain Joined Computers Find DCs
1. Domain joined computer sends DNS request to retrieve **list of DCs** in the domain
2. Computer uses **LDAP ping** to test connectivity to DCs
3. DCs examine computer's IP, cross references it with list of subnet objects, finds the right site, sends back the **site name**
4. **Computer stores site name** in registry and sends another DNS request to retrieve list of all DCs in the local site
5. Computer uses LDAP ping to test connectivity to DCs
6. Computer receives response from DC in local site, **caches the DC's name** and uses it going forward to authenticate

### Tools
- `repadmin`
- `dcdiag`
- PowerShell cmdlets
