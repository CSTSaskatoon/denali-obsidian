# Manage Objects in AD
## Create user Accounts
- Allow users to sign into the domain from any computer in the domain (except for DCs)

### Created using
- Command line tools such as `dsadd`
- Active Directory Users and Computers
- Active Directory Administrative Center
- PowerShell

### Attributes
- Some are mandatory (Ex. UPN)
- Some are optional (Ex. email, phone)

#### Username attributes
- First Name, Middle Initial, Last Name
- Full Name (Display Name) - must be unique to **container**
- User Principle Name (`UPN`) - must be unique to **forest**
- Pre-Windows 2000 logon name (`SamAccountName`) - must be unique to the **domain**

#### Account Tab Attributes
- Logon hours
- Logon to
- Expiration date
- smart card

##### Password Related
- User must change password at next logon
- Password never expires
- User can't change password
- Store password using reversible encryption
- Account is trusted for delegation

#### Additional Attributes
- **Organization** tab - job title, department, manager
- **General** tab - office, email, webpage, phone
- **Member of** tab - What groups the user is a member of
- **Profile** tab - Where user profile is stored (locally or network server)

## Delete User Accounts
- Accounts have a unique SID
- Deleting a user permanently deletes it's SID
- If an account is deleted and you create another one with the same username/password, a new SID will be generated and it will treat the account as new
- Safer to disable the account first
- Disabling an account retains the SID, rights and permissions

## Template objects for Users
- AD Users and Computers
- Naming convention `_Name_Schema` is used so it will appear at the top of lists
- These template accounts are just user accounts that cannot be logged into
    - Just copy these accounts and rename them
        - Some items are not saved between objects that are considered unique, such as address and phone numbers
            - You can control click and edit multiple users to configure the same field on those users
- `\\server\name\%username%` can be used to use user account name to make a home directory

## Distinguished Names (DN)
- Like the absolute path for a file, has to be unique

### Example Structure
*Just an illustration, not how an actual file would look*
```PowerShell
Contoso.com:
	# Auto, Containers, Can't be assigned group policies
	Computers:
		- wk1 # cn=wk1,cn=Computers,dc=Contoso,dc=com
	Users:
		- Mark # cn=Mark,cn=Users,dc=Contoso,dc=com

	# Manual, Organizational Unit (OU), CAN be assigned group policies
	HR:
		- Bob # cn=Bob,ou=HR,dc=Contoso,dc=com
	IT:
		- June # cn=June,ou=IT,dc=Contoso,dc=com
```

### Commands
- `dsadd /?` - gives you information on how to add a user, group, ou, computer, query, etc.
- `dsadd user /?` - gives you information on how to add a user object
- `dsadd user <USER_DN>` - create a user with the DN specified
- `dsmod user <USER_DN>` - modify the user with the specified DN's attributes
- `dsrm <OBJECT_DN>` - Remove a specific object
- `dsquery`
- `dsget`
- `csvde` - comma separated value data exchange, formats the response from queries to CSV
- `ldifde` - lets you export query info to `.ldif` files

## Security and Distribution Groups
### Security Groups
- Have SID
- Can be assigned rights and permissions
- Can be email-enabled

### Distribution Groups
- Don't have SID
- Can't be assigned rights and permissions
- Are intended for email distribution

### Converting Group Type
- If you convert a security group to distribution, it loses it's SID

## Groups
### Scope
- Indicates where it can be used to assign rights and permissions
- Local - only on one local computer
- Domain Local - Resources in it's own domain only
- Global - Any resource in the forest
- Universal - Any resource in the forest

### Membership rule
- Local - Any domain in the forest and local accounts
- Domain Local - any domain in the forest
- Global - Own domain only
- Universal - Any domain in the forest

### Nesting
- Local - Domain local, global, or universal groups from any domain in the forest
- Domain local - Other domain local groups, global, or universal groups from any domain in the forest
- Global - Global groups from its own domain
- Universal - Global and universal groups from any domain in the forest

### Management - [IGDLA](https://medium.com/tech-jobs-academy/igdla-and-you-a-fledgling-s-guide-to-nesting-e09b748e3a60)
- MS recommends **Identities** (users and computers) should be added to *Global* groups
- Can use universal groups if you need the user to access stuff in different domains

### Restricted Groups
- Setting in Group Policy
- Specify membership of the group
- When you apply members of this group setting, user specified in the policy are added to the group, and users not in the policy are deleted from the group
- If you modify the *This group is a member of* setting, the group is added to the specific group

### Default Groups
- builtin local groups are created automatically and given preassigned rights and permissions
- Examples are Administrators, Backup Operators, Account Operators
- In AD, these groups display in the *builtin* container
- Default global groups are created in the Users container (Domain Administrators and Domain Users)

### Special Identities
- Can't manually add users to these, done by the system
- Users are added to these dynamically based on activity
- Ex. Anonymous logon, Authenticated Users, Everyone, Creator Owner
