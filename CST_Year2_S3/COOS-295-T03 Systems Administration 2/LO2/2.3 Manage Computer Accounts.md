# Manage Computer Accounts
## Default Computers Container
- Computer is a builtin container
- Not an OU
- Can't have group policies linked to it
- Can delegate control over it
- LDAP abbreviation of CN is used instead of OU

## Create an OU structure for managing Computers
- Create OUs to represent locations/departments
- Create OUs to represent different types of computers (desktops, laptops, tablets, servers)
- Or use a combination with nesting

## Control who can create computer objects
- Joining a computer to a domain creates a computer account or attaches to a pre-staged computer account
- Ability to join computers to a domain resets on the default user right *Add workstations to domain* and delegated permissions to create computer objects

## Secure Channel Failures
- Secret password created for the machine when joined to the domain, lets the machine authenticate to DC
- If you reset the machine or something you will need to get a new one

### Reset the secure Channel
- `dsmod computer "computerDN" -reset`

## Offline domain Joins
- Something you can do

## PowerShell to manage User Accounts
### Cmdlets
