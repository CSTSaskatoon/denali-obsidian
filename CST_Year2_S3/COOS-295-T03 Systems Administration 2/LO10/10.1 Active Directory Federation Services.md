# Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
- Enables organizations to provide users with the ability to sign in and authenticate to services and apps locally, in partner companies and online
- Provides **Single Sign On** (SSO) functionality

## Identity Federation
- Allows identification, authentication, and authorization across organizational and platform boundaries
- Requires federated trust relationship between two entities/organizations
- Enables organizations to retain control over who can access resources
- Enables organizations to retain control of their user and group accounts

### Claims-based identity and Claims-based authentication
- Claims provide information about users
- User's identity provider supplies information that the provider accepts

### What is AD FS
- MS Identity product that uses claims-based authentication

#### Features
- SSO for web-based apps
- Interoperability with web services on several platforms
- Support for many clients such as web browsers, mobile devices and applications
- Extensibility to support customized claims from non-MS applications
- Delegation of account management to the user's organization

## Components
- Federation Server (Federation Services role)
- Web Application Proxy/Federation Server Proxy
- Claims (Attributes)
- Claims rules (Client computer consumes the claim)
- Attribute store (Will always be AD)
- Claims providers (Where the users are, **trusted**)
- Relying parties (Where the resources being accessed are, **trusting**)
- Claims provider trust (Set up on the relying party)
- Relying party trust (Set up on the claims provider)
- Certificates
- Endpoints

### Critical Roles
- Claims Provider Federated Server - Authenticate internal users, Issues signed tokens containing user claims
- Relying party Federation Server - Consumes tokens from claims provider, Issues tokens for Application Access
- Federation Service Proxy - Deployed to perimeter network, layer of security for internal federation servers

## Requirements
- TCP/IP network connectivity
- AD DS
- Attribute stores (In our case AD)
- DNS
