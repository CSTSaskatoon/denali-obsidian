# Monitoring and Recovery for AD DS
## Bottlenecks
- Component impacting server performance
- Processor
- Disk subsystem
- Memory
- Network
- Potential bottlenecks depend on the service the server is running

## Monitoring Tools
- Task Manager
- Resource Manger
- Performance Monitor

## Event Properties
- Message description
- Event ID
- Date and time
- User account name (if any)
- Computer name
- Link to online help

## Event Viewer
- Create custom views
- Examine local or remote computer's logs
- Trigger alerts
- Review details of events

### Major logs
- Application Log
- Security log
- Setup log
- System log
- Forwarded events
- Other logs

## Performance Monitor
- Real time monitoring and logging
- Can track local or remote computer's performance counters
- Data collector sets store data in log files
- **baselines**, spot trends

### Views
- Line chart
- Histogram
- Report

### Objects, counters and instances
- Hardware and software components represented as objects
- Each object has counters that can be tracked
- If there are multiple instances of an object you can choose which one to track

#### Processor
- Common object counters are % Processor time, Interrupts/sec
- System object counter has Processor Queue length as well
- If the processor is the bottleneck, upgrade it

#### Memory
- If you run out of RAM it pages to disk and slows down your system
- Common counters are Pages/sec and Committed bytes
- If memory is a bottleneck, download more RAM

#### Disk
- Physical Disk tracks disk drives
- Common counters are % disk time, Avg. Disk Queue Length
- If disk is a bottleneck, get more space, use an SSD or use RAID

#### Network
- Network Interface, tracks installed NICs
- Common counters are Byte Total/sec, Output queue length, Current Bandwidth
- If NIC is the bottleneck, either upgrade the NIC or other network infrastructure

### Active Directory Performance
- NTDS object
- Common counters are DS Directory reads/sec

### Data Collector sets
- Performance counters
- Trace logs
- Registry snapshot
- Create baselines for your servers
- Pre-configured sets are **System Diagnostics** and **System Performance**

## Active Directory Database
### Partitions
- Schema Partition - defines object classes and attributes, replicates to all DCs in the forest
- Domain Partition - Instances of objects created in the domain, replicates to all DCs in the domain
- Configuration - Structure of forest, replicates to all DCs in the forest
- Application - Data stored by AD-aware apps, typically separate partition for each app, replicates to specific DCs

### Database files
- `NTDS.dit` - actual database file
- `Edb*.log` - transaction log files
- `Edb.chk` - Track  which transactions have been committed to database file
- `Edbres00001.jrs` and `Edbres00002.jrs` - Used if transaction logs are full or no disk space is available for new log file

### `ntdsutil.exe` to Manage the AD Database
- Offline defragmentation - only needs to run to recover lots of disk space
- Online defragmentation - runs every 12 hours during garbage collection
- Moving database files
- Cleaning up metadata
- Removing redundant objects
- Creating and mounting AD snapshots
- Resetting DSRM password

### Restartable AD DS
- Introduced in Windows Server 2008
- States are Normal, Stopped and DSRM

### System State Data
- Snapshot of essential config files
- Use Windows Server Backup
- On every server system, this includes Boot files, Registry and COM database
- On DCs, it also includes AD DS database files and the SYSVOL folder content

### Snapshots
- Managed by `ntdsutil.exe` and `dsamain.exe`
- ntdsutil can create, list, mount/unmount snapshots
- Make the snapshot available on any TCP port with dsamain and view it With Users and Computers

### Object Deletion and Recovery
- When you delete an object, it is recoverable for 180 days (Tombstoning)
- **Active Directory Recycle Bin** - objects don't lose any data, done Through Administration Center
- If you don't have the Recycle Bin enabled, you risk attributes losing data

### Windows Server Backup
- Included with Windows Server, can either backup to a local server or network
- Not installed by default
- Supports full server backup, system state data backup, or specific files/folders/volumes

### Azure Backup
- This exists
- Install agent on target computers

### Authoritative and Non-Authoritative Restores
