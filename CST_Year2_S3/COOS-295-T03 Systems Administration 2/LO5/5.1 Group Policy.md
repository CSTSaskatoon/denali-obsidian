# Group Policy
- Collection of Settings
- Remotely configure Computers
- Specific to Windows

## Configuration Management
- Centralized approach to configuring computer and user settings
- Settings, Scopes and Applications

### Tools
- Windows Active Directory Group Policy
- Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager - Best option, used on System Centre
- Microsoft Intune
- **Group Policy Management Console** - Your first entry point, installed automatically, where you install and link policies (Policy will be blank or have a template, have to edit it with GPO Editor)
- **Group Policy Management Editor** - Edit a policy's properties (Ex. remove a run command)
- `gpupdate` - used on cmd, forces an update of the group policy
- `gpresult` - used on cmd, displays a summarization of all policies applied to an object (Ex. two policies overlap, one granting access and one denying it - this will show you the end result)
- Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) - Graphical version of `gpresult`

#### For Managing AD DS
- Active Directory Users and Computers
- Active Directory Administrative Center
- Windows PowerShell

## Benefits of GP
- Powerful and flexible
- Pushing configuration settings to a large number of domain joined computers (All done through AD)

### Can Configure
- Security (Ex. default password expiry)
- Desktop and App settings (Ex. Policies for Office 365)
- Application Deployment
- Folder Redirection (Useful if you have an NFS)
- Networking

## Group Policy Objects (GPO)
- Set of settings
- Can apply or link it to a container object in AD DS such as a site, domain or Organization Unit (OU)
- **Preferences** - Configure Windows and control panel settings (*Not mandated*, can be configured by user)
- **Policies** - Mandate user and computer settings (*Mandated*, can't be changed by user)

### Policy Settings for User Configuration
- Application Deployment
- Logon and logoff scripts
- Folder redirection
- Administrative Template settings

### Policy Settings for Computer Configuration
- Application Deployment
- Startup and shutdown scripts
- Security Settings
- Administrative Template Settings

### Approaches
- Create and link a GPO **one aspect** of computer/user configuration (More modular, granular, but lots more objects, good for **large organizations**)
- Create and link a GPO to manage **ALL aspects** of computer and user configuration for particular department/team (Less modular, but easier to read, less objects, better for **small organizations**)

### Manage Scope and Inheritance
- Can scope to Sites, Domains and OUs
- Settings configured by high-level GPOs are inherited by objects in lower level containers

#### Process Order
- If there is a **conflict**, **last one takes priority**
- If there isn't a conflict, they are **cumulative**

##### Domain Joined
1. Local GPOs - basically never used
2. Site linked GPOs
3. Domain Linked GPOs - not that common to apply things here because it's too high-level
4. OU Linked GPOs - Most influential, can overwrite every single other policy if you really want
5. Child OU GPOs

##### Control Default Behavior
- Link Order - Most important
- Enforced
- Block Inheritance
- Link Enabled
- WMI Filters
- Security Filters
- Loopback Processing

### Group Policy Client Service and Extensions
- Run by every client computer
- determines where relevant GPOs are, downloads the policies, client-side extensions go through them all and reconfigure the local computer accordingly

## Domain-based GPOs
- Any GPO you create in AD DS and store on DCs is domain based
- Two default policies - **Default Domain Policy** and **Default Domain Controllers Policy** - Recommended to not fuck with these
- Can run `dcgpofix` cmd tool to recover default domain policies

### GPO Storage and Replication
- **Group Policy Container** - versioning and attribute information, stored in AD DS
- **Group Policy Template** - GPO settings, stored in `SYSVOL` on DCs

#### Replication
- Container replicated with **Active Directory Replication**
- Template replicated with **Distributed File System Replication** (DFSR)
- Templates are at `C:\Windows\SYSVOL\domain\Policies\<guid>`

### Starter GPOs
- Configure initial settings in a GPO, after which you can configure additional settings
- Can use any GPO as a starter GPO (This is really just copying a GPO)
- Basically just a preset/template so you don't have to configure everything from scratch

### Management Tasks
- Create
- Edit
- Backup
- Restore
- Import
- Copy

#### Management Tables
- Give you more control over import/copy tasks
- Some GPOs contain shared folder of UNC path references
- By using migration tables you can change the UNC path in all of them at once

### Delegation
- Can delegate all management tasks

#### Full Permissions by default
- Domain Admins
- Enterprise Admins
- Group Policy Creators or Owners
- Local System

### Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Filters
- Basically a query language
- Can script shit
- Filter computer objects in an OU - Useful for things like computers with different hardware

### Loopback Processing
- When you have computers used specifically for certain scenarios that you want to manage with more restrictive settings
- Can Either use a GPO linked to the OU or a GPO linked to the domain and use Security Filtering
- Since the User Settings override the Computer Settings in a GPO, you can use this to instead make computer settings

#### Modes
- Replace - Won't run the User Settings in the policy at all
- Merge - Overrides the User Settings by running the Computer Settings again

### Slow Links and Disconnected Systems
- Some policies won't work well if the connection is slow

### Identify when settings become effective
- GPO edits aren't immediately effective across the whole organization
- Changes become effective when editor is closed
- AD Replication and DFSR must replicate changes to other DCs
- Clients must refresh the changed GPOs (Can use `gpupdate`)
- Users must sometimes sign out and back in (Especially with User Settings)
- Computers must sometimes be restarted (Especially with Computer Settings)
- `gpupdate /force /logoff /boot` - run on client computer, force the update and reboots the computer

## Troubleshoot Application of GPOs
### Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP)
#### In Group Policy Management
- Group Policy Modeling Wizard
- Group Policy Results Wizard

#### In Command Line
- `GPResult.exe`
- `RSoP.exe`
- `Get-GPResultantSetOfPolicy`

### Event Logs
- System Log
- Application Log
- Group Policy Operational Log - Will say if the replication happened or not

### Detect Issues with Health of GPOs
- Use GP Management console to generate health reports
- Can perform an analysis on an entire domain or just one GPO
