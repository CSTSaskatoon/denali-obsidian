# Deploy And Manage Certificates
## Certificates

- Public and Private key

## Certificate Templates
- Stored in **Configuration** partition of AD DS (Replicated to every DC)
- Contain settings used to create templates
- Have permissions that define who can obtain certificates
- Are configured using the **Certificate Templates** Console

### Schema Versions

- `<` Windows Server 2012 CAs or Windows 8 Clients - Key storage provider is version **3**, Legacy Cryptographic Service Provider is version **2**
- `>=` Windows Server 2012 CAs or Windows 8 Clients - Version **4**
- Schema version 1 templates can't be modified and don't support autoenrollment
- New schema version = More advanced settings

### Template Settings
- Certificate Purpose
- Encryption Protocols
- Minimum Key Size
- Validity Period
- Renewal Period

### Permissions
- Full Control
- Read
- Write
- Enroll
- Auto-enroll (Recommended)

### Updating
 - Modifying an existing template applies to all new certs, renewals and increments the minor version number
 - Reenroll all certificate holders increments major version number
 - Superseding an existing certificate template links the superseded template certificate's template to the replacement, allows testing prior to deployment

## Enrollment Methods
### Certificate Request Files

- Configure Autoenrollment

### Autoenrollment

- AD DS (LDAP)
- File Share
- HTTP URL

### Online Certificate Status Protocol

## Key Archival and Recovery
- Archival - Making a duplicate of the key (basically a backup)
- Recovery - Using the duplicated/archived/backed up key to recover data
- Authentication Certificates are easily replaced
- Data encryption certificates might result in loss of data
- Certificates for keys are stored in user profiles
- Use Certificates snap-in for manual key archival
- "**Allow private key to be exported**" toggle in properties of a user in the CA console lets you do it **manually**

### Automatic Key Archival

- Private key is stored securely in CA database
- Key recovery agent can access the private key
- **Archive Key** toggle in the Recovery Agents tab of the properties for a container in the CA console lets you do it **automatically**
- Issues a KRA certificate
- There are templates for key archival

## Certificates for Digital Signatures
