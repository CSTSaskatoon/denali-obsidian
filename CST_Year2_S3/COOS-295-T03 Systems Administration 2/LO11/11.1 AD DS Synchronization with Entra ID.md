# AD DS Synchronization with Entra ID
## Scope and Limitations
- Primarily for On-premises deployments, single tenant by design, not suited for internet communication, requires domain-joined computers
- Can use AD DS for Auth of cloud-based services and mobile devices by using AD FS and Web app proxy
- Can deploy AD DS DC in Azure for redundancy

## Entra ID
- Designed to support online services
- Support for web based apps
- Objects are created in non-hierachical, flat structure
- Doesn't use Kerberos
- Has strong and wide federation support
- Natively supports enhanced security features
- 2FA built in

### Authentication
- Cloud only authentication - no AD DS
- Directory Synchronization with optional password hash synchronization - simplest
- Single sign on with AD FS - works the most consistently
- Pass-through authentication

### Synchronization
- By default it's one way from AD DS to Entra
- Uses have common hybrid identity across on-premises and cloud based services
- All attributes modified on AD DS are replicated to Entra (Also applies to deleting/disabling objects)
- Can be monitored with **Entra ID Connect Health**
- Can filter which ones are filtered to a Domain, OU or by attributes
