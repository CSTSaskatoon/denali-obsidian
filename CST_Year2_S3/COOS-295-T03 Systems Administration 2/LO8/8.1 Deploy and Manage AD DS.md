# Deploy and Manage AD DS
## Deploy Certificate Authorities
- Have one **Root CA** server that has authority
- **subordinate CA** servers are below root

## AD CS
- Server role that lets you create CAs that issue and manage certificates

### Role Services
- Certification Authority - core role, need at least one to issue certs
- Certification Authority Web Enrollment - web interface
- Online Responder - alternative service for validation
- Network Device Enrollment Service - supports network devices
- Certificate Enrollment Web Service - Used by non-domain joined computers to request certs
- Certificate Enrollment Policy Web Service - Used by clients to query the service

### Options for Hierarchies
- For best security, use an offline root CA
- Consider how many tiers you need
- use a **cross-certification trust** to merge two hierarchies, trust each other, more than one root CA
- **Two-tier** hierarchy is default, root CA makes the certs and subordinate CAs issue them

### Standalone vs Enterprise
- Standalone isn't integrated with AD DS
- Enterprise does integrate with AD DS
- Enterprise can also use templates, autoenrollment, publish CA certs in AD DS, publish user/computer certs in AD DS, provide Certificate Enrollment Web Service

## Factors to Consider for a root CA
- Desktop or Server Core?
- CA hierarchy planning
- After deploying you can't change the computer name or domain membership

### Configuration Options
- Cryptographic provider (which algorithm)
- Key length
- Hash Algorithm
- Validity period (default is 5 years)

### Offline Root CA
- Publish root A certs as a trusted root
- Properly configure the AIA and CDP locations as non-local

### Subordinate CA Organization
- Load Balancing - If you only have one server issuing certs and it goes down you're cooked
- Usage - server for different types of services
- Organization Divisions
- Geographical Locations

## `CAPolicy.inf`
- Used when you install a CA or renew a cert
- Contains some settings you can't configure in the wizard

## Manage CAs
- **Certification Authority** console - Graphical tool, can use for pretty much anything
- **`Certutil.exe`**
- **PowerShell**

## Configure CA Security
### Default Permissions
- Authenticated Users - Request Certificates
- Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins - Issue and manage Certificates, Manage CA

### Security Roles
- CA Administrator
- Certificate Manager
- Backup Operator
- Auditor
- Enrollee

### Policy and Exit Modules
#### Policy Module
- How it's processed
- Windows default options - wait for approval, process based on certificate template permissions

#### Exit Module
- Defines action performed after cert is issued
- No actions by default

### Certification Revocation Distribution Point (CDP)
- Standalone CAs can't publish their certs in AD DS
- Offline root CAs ensure CDP and AIA locations are available when root is offline

### Authority Information Access (AIA)
