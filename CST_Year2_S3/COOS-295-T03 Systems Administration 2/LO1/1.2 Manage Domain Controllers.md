# Manage Domain Controllers
## What is a Domain Controller
- Windows Server computer installed with the AD DS role and promoted into the directory
- Provide auth services
- Implement Kerberos
- Advertise their services using SRV records in DNS
- Support LDAP
- Store copy of database in a file named `Ntds.dit`
- Maintain a copy of the `SYSVOL` folder (stores group policies and startup scripts)
- Use multi-master replication to maintain synchronized state of both `Ntds.dit` and `SYSVOL`

## Global Catalog Servers
- Selected to host a replica of an additional AD DS partition
- Contains subset of attributes for all objects in the forest
- Requires DC with Schema Masters role
- use Schema snap-in to add the attribute

### Recommendations
- For a single domain environment, make all DCs global catalog servers
- In multi-domain, ensure any DCs holding the 'infrastructure operations master' role are not global catalog servers (unless all DCs are global catalog)
- Ensure you have at least one global catalog server per physical AD DS site

## SVR Records
- DCs register SRV records with their configured DNS server that identify the AD DS services they provide

## Login process
- User types in username/password
- Sent to DC
- DC checks AD
- DC Generates 'Ticket Granting Ticket' (TGT) and sends to user computer
- User computer sends TGT back to DC or other server (Ex. file server)
- Server determines if the user has access or not and sends back a service ticket

## Transfer and Seize Roles
- **Schema master** - low, forest level - extending/creating new schema
- **Domain Naming master** - low, forest level
- **PDC emulator** - high, domain level - Time service, password updates, group policies
- **Infrastructure master** - low, domain level - Reference for interdomain group memberships
- **RID master** - medium, domain level - Supplies Security Identifiers (SIDs) to DCs

### Commands
Review current role holders - `Get-ADForest | fl SchemaMaster, DomainNamingMaster`
Seize roles - `Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationsMasterRole -Identity "Contoso-SVR1" -OperationsMasterRole PDCEmulator, RIDMaster -Force`

## Azure Active Directory (Entra ID)
- provide auth for cloud apps
- SSO
- Conditional Access
- MFA
- Web-based management console

### AD DS vs Entra ID
#### AD DS
- hierarchical
- Granular
- On-Premises
- Configuration through Group Policies
- Support for LDAP and Kerberos

#### Entra ID
- Flat architecture
- Less granular control
- RBAC

### Entra ID Versions
- Free
- Microsoft Office 365 Apps
- Premium P1
- Premium P2

### Domain Services
- Resembles functionality of AD DS
- Serverless, don't require IaaS VMs running DCs
