# Deploy Active Directory Services
- Hierarchical directory service
- Stores security principles such as **Users**, **Groups** and **Computers**
- Elements also include **Forests**, Trees, **Domains**, **Organization Units** (**OU**), and **Sites**.
- **Domain Controllers** (**DC**) host a writable instance of AD DS and provide authentication and Authorization services for users and computers
- Server needs the *Active Directory Directory Services Role* to be a DC
- **Promote** the Server to be the DC, which puts it inside a **Domain**
- Domain has a namespace (usually company name, Ex. `contoso.com`)
- To put a DC in a Domain, it needs to be in a **Forest**
- **Forest Root** contains all the 'universal' information (Ex. Enterprise Admins, Schema Admins)

### Organizational Units (OUs)
- Group objects together
- Group Policy Application
- Administration Delegation (Giving admin control to someone who isn't an admin)
