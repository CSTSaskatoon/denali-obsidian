# Secure AD DS
## Security Settings on a DC
- Default Domain Controllers policy contains default **User Rights Assignment** and **Security Options** settings
- Security Compliance Toolkit gives recommended settings
- **Center for Internet Security** (CIS) - community sourced

## Secure Authentication
- Require secure passwords
- Secure groups with elevated permissions
- Audit changes to critical objects
- Use separate accounts for Administration and day to day tasks
- Deploy MFA
- Segment network activity
- Remove unused accounts
- Secure client computers

## Secure Physical Access
- Only allow DC deployment to physically secure locations
- Use RODCs for less secure locations
- Enable Bitlocker encryption
- Monitor swapping of mirrored drives
- Protect virtual disks
- Keep DC Backups in secure locations

## Read Only Domain Controllers (RODC)
- Usage Scenarios are Branch offices and Perimeter networks
- Control password sync (Passwords only stored on primary DCs and cached memory on RODC by default)
- Local Administrative access
- Some limitations based on read-only AD DS and SYSVOL

### Password Replication Policy
- Can build a list of what ones should be cached
- Don't want any account in the list to have elevated access
- Domain groups that apply to all RODCs - Allowed/Denied RODC Password Replication Group

### Local Administration
- Can't access AD DS
- Review event logs
- Start and stop services
- Restart the server
- Manage hardware
- Manage apps and server roles
- Delegate using staged install, managed by tab or PowerShell

## Account Security In Windows Server
### Policies
- Password Policies - where you would set things like password age, history, complexity requirements, etc.
- Account Lockout Policies - How many attempts before it locks you out, how long, etc.
- Kerberos Authentication Policies - All about tickets

### Fine Grained Password and Lockout Policies
- Fine Grained Password policies - Useful for elevated users to have specific settings
- If you have many of these Password Setting Objects (PSO), user-linked have higher priority than group linked, also precedence values and Lower GUID is tie breaker
- Domain Admins have management permissions delegate ability to link PSO via one of the object's attributes
- Can be created and managed in AD Administrative Center or PowerShell

### Restricted Groups In AD DS
- Applies to a local group (often Administrators)
- Specify members of a local group - local group is restricted, only listed members are allowed
- Add members to a local group - Domain group is restricted, it's specified as a member of a local group

### Protected Users Security Group
- On the DC
- Anyone you put in here, none of the information will be cached on the workstation

### Windows Hello
- Not really used for AD DS, only workstations
- Biometrics, pins, etc.
- Business version uses certificates and the TPM

### Securing Accounts in Entra ID
- MFA
- Conditional Access Policies
- Privileged Identity Management

## Auditing Authentication
### Logon Events
- Generated on the computer with the resources being accessed
- Found on workstations, file servers and app servers

### Account Logon Events
- Generated on the computer that is authoritative for the account
- Found on DCs for domain accounts

## Service Accounts
- Define security permissions for a service
- Often use built-in local accounts (Local System, Local Service, Network Service)

### Challenges
- Limiting permissions
- Managing their passwords
- Tracking service account usage
- Managing Service Principle Name (SPN) for services

### Service Principle Names
- Required for Kerberos
- In the format `servicename/host`
- Registered on the computer account when the service uses a built-in account
- Registered as service account when running as domain user
- Can't be registered on multiple objects

#### Kerberos Authentication Delegation
- Enables a service to pass user credentials to another service
- Can be constrained to specific SPN

## Managed Service Accounts (MSA)
- Manage SPNs for the service
- Use the same password mechanism as computer accounts in AD DS
- not affected by account lockout policies
- Restricted to a single server

### Group MSA
- Can be used on multiple computers
- Good for High availability
