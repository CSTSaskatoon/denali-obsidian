# Manage User Settings with GP
## Administrative Templates
- Bulk of configuration settings in a GPO
- sometimes referred to as *registry-based policies*

### Computer Configuration Node
- Uses **`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`** hive
- Control Panel
- Network
- *Printers*
- *Server*
- Start Menu and Taskbar
- System
- Windows Components
- All Settings

### User Configuration Node
- Uses **`HKEY_CURRENT_USER`** hive
- Control Panel
- Network
- *Desktop*
- *Shared Folders*
- Start Menu and Taskbar
- System
- Windows Components
- All Settings

### ADMX Files
- Define Administrative templates

### Central Store
- Ensure all DCs use the same ADMX files
- Must create it manually on a selected DC
- Ensures all available settings in Administrative Templates are the same on all DCs, only need to maintain a single set of ADMX files in one location

## Folder Redirection
- Syncs user data to defined network location
- Users access documents from any domain joined computer
- Can access content even if they're offline
- Can easily back up data on files servers
- User profile size is reduced because data is no longer part of the profile

### What Folders Can be Redirected
- Pretty much all of them in your profile
- Has to be done folder by folder, not just the entire profile
- `Documents` is the most common

### Settings
- Right click on the folder in the policy, go to properties
- Basic redirect puts everyone's folder in the same place (Ex. `\\Contoso.com\Users\blazedrust\Documents`)
- Advanced redirect specifies location based on your group membership (Ex. `\\Contoso-DC\Users\blazedrust\Documents` or `\\Contoso-MKTING\Users\blazedrust\Documents`)
- Can grant the user exclusive rights (Even admin doesn't have access, but will have issues with backups)

### Manage Software with Group Policy
- User Deployment - Assign or publish an app to users
- Computer Deployment - Assign apps to computers
- Assign installs the software when you start the computer
- Publish doesn't install the software right away, it just lists it as available to install somewhere

#### Advantages
- App deployment is integrated feature
- Deployment is agentless
- Can remotely uninstall apps (Good for licensing restrictions)

#### Disadvantages
- Feature set is limited
- No reporting available
- Can only install windows installer packages (`.msi`)

#### Configuration Options for Assigned Apps
- App name
- Deployment Type
- Uninstall Options
- Upgrade Options

#### Configuration Options for Published Apps
- App Name
- Deployment type
- File extension options
- Uninstall options
- Control panel options
- Upgrade options
- Category
