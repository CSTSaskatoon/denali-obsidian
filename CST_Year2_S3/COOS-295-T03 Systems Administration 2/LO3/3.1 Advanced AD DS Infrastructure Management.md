# Advanced AD DS Infrastructure Management
## Domain and Forest Boundaries
- Advanced deployments typically contain multiple domains and forests
- Choice between creating a domain in a new or existing forest is based on differences between domain and forest boundaries

### Domain Boundaries
- Domain Naming Context replication - all users, computer objects
- DNS zone replication (domain-wide) - put DNS in your AD (AD integrated DNS), replicates between every DC in the domain
- Delegated administration - Authorization Boundary (Domain admin can't change things in other domains)
- Group policy Object scoping - Can't link a GPO from domain 1 to domain 2

### Forest Boundaries
- Schema and configuration naming context replication
- DNS zone replication (forest-wide)
- Security isolation - Enterprise Administrators group created when you create your first domain in a forest (Forest Root), not replicated to other DCs, future domains will be children of first one (Ex. `sp.ca` -> `cst.sp.ca`)
- Global Catalog replication - mainly so every domain knows what groups users in different domains are in

## Active Directory Partitions
- **Schema Partition** - replicates all DCs in forest
- **Configuration Partition** - Replications to all DCs in the forest
- **Domain Partition** - Replicates to all DCs within a global domain, object portion becomes part of global catalog
- **Application Partition** - AD integrated DNS, two application partitions for DNS zones
- **NTDS.dit**

## Multiple Domains and Forests
- Recommended approach is to start with a single forest
- Avoid creating additional domains/forests

### Common Reasons for Multiple Domains
- Bandwidth limitations
- Distributed support/operational model
- Separation of resource/user administration - if you have users and resources in separate domains, linked by a trust
- Separation of forest-level operations (empty root domain) - First domain only has Enterprise Admin and basic settings, Users and resources would all be in subdomains

### Common Reasons for Multiple Forests
- Bandwidth limitations
- Security isolation - If you want to not have an Enterprise Admin above you
- Conflicting Schema requirements
- Regulatory/compliance requirements
- Extranet deployments
- Business mergers and divestitures

## Upgrading Active Directory
### AD DS Domain and Forest Function Levels
- Determine capabilities available in AD DS domains and forests
- Determine lowest OS version of AD DS DCs - doesn't restrict to the OS version supported on domain-joined computers, but might affect their functionality
- Windows Server 2016 is the most recent OS associated with the domain and forest functional level updates
- Windows Server 2022 DCs require at minimum Windows Server 2008 domain and Forest functional levels
- Starting with Windows Server 2008 R2 it's possible to revert an update provided the optional features of the new version haven't been activated
- **Lowest common denominator** - If you have one server running 2016, the functional level will be 2016

#### Domain Functional Level
- One domain
- Can't upgrade this until all servers in the domain are upgraded

##### Windows Server Versions

#### Forest Functional Level
- Ex. different departments
- Same as domain but it applies to the whole forest

##### Windows Server Versions

## Upgrade and Migrate AD DS Domains

## Factors to consider for Complex AD DS Environments
### DNS Considerations
- Use AD DS Integrated DNS Zones
- Choose between centralized/decentralized
- Verify DNS client settings
- Optimize cross-namespace name resolution

### UPN Considerations
- Choice of UPN suffixes
- Availability of global catalogs

## Configure AD Trusts
- [Additional content](WIndows%20AD%20Trusts%20-%20Additional%20content.pdf)
- Relationships between two domains
- Allow users in one domain the ability to authenticate and access resources on another domain, forest or realm
- If you use a single domain, trusts don't exist
- Trusts DO exist between domain controller and domain joined computers
- Instead of using local account stored in SAM, it trusts the DC authentication with an account stored in AD

### Windows Trusts
- MS recommends single domain, single forest until you have specific requirements because it simplifies things

### Workstation Trusts
- users or machines not known to the individual workstation are unable to authenticate against the workstation
- To add the workstation to the domain, local user on the workstation must be admin, domain account credentials provided with appropriate permissions (Domain Administrator) to complete the trust
- When workstation is added, domain users have the ability to authenticate and access the workstation's resources
- workstation is **trusting resources**, Windows domain is **trusted by users**

### Domain Trusts
- Administration of multiple domains within or across forest relies on this for access to resources

### Trusts and Access
- Normally Trust does not equal access
- Only establishes the relationship where the trusting domain's admin can 'see' the users and groups in the trusted domain
- Trusted domain's users and groups have no access to resources in trusting domain until trusting domain's admin adds the users/groups to an ACL and adds them to a **Domain Local Group** in the trusting domain that has access to resources

#### Characteristics
##### Method of Creation
- Automatic - At forest/domain creation
- Manual - trust created after the fact

###### Automatic
- Made when you create a new child or tree root in a forest
- internal to a forest and created during domain creation
- transitive
- ALWAYS Two way

###### Manual
- Can be created to connect two domains within the same forest to one another or to a forest/domain of another enterprise
- Can be one or two way
- Can be transitive or non-transitive
- Types are **External**, **Forest**, **Shortcut** and **Realm**
- Need either Admin in both domains, or Enterprise Admin

##### Direction
- One way or two way
- **Trusting** is giving trust to the **trusted**

###### One way
- Any users in resource domain cannot access resources in the trusted domain

##### Transitivity
- non-transitive or transitive
- Determines how far the trust relationship authentication requests can traverse existing trust authentication paths
- Basically how many children deep can you go before you lose authentication
- Nontransitive means that it doesn't give a single fuck if you are a the child of a trusted domain, it will not trust you.

##### External Trust
- One or two way
- Links two domains not in the same forest
- ALWAYS non-transitive

##### Forest Trusts
- Every domain in a forest has a two-way trust with one another from the forest root domain down
- Therefore it's fully transitive to all domains in the trusting forest
- Have to be Domain admin in both domains or enterprise admin in both

###### Situations
- Integrating two forests during acquisition/merger
- Collaborating two business closely together
- etc.

##### Shortcut Trusts
- One or two way
- **Transitive** between domains in the same forest
- Improves performance when authenticating to and accessing resources in internal forest
- If only one way, authentication path is optimized only for authentication to trusting domain
- Basically if you have a really big nested structure, and you often go from one of the deep child domains to a different root domain, do this so you don't have to go all the way back up the parent chain to your root parent

##### Validating Trusts
- Existing trusts might need to be validated in the event of failure/problems between trusted and trusting domains
- Troubleshoot and reset relationships

##### Trust Authentication
- Defines how explicit the authentication and access to trusting domain will be
- Scopes are **Selective**, **Domain-wide** and **Forest-wide**
- Configured on **external** and **forest** trusts
