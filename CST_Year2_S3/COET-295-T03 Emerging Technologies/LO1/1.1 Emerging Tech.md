# Emerging Tech
- People in the mid 20th century and before believed technology could solve anything

## Problems with Modern Technology
- Modern Media (Twitter, Facebook)
- Green Movement - against the industrialization of the Earth
- Vaccinations
- ChatGPT - Why should anyone work?

## Job Loss through Technology
- Unless you're an Entrepreneur you can't get a high paying job with a high school education
- Automation has mostly been blamed
- High paying jobs lost as manufacturers shifted production overseas
- Alibaba says 72 hour work weeks should be normal
- Firms are experimenting with LLMs to reduce costs with spotty results

## Historical Perspective
- New Tech is not always accepted
- If your current system works, why change things, Roman Empire is a good example
- Religious teachings also play part in restricting new tech

## Modern Examples
- Still hard to get new ideas accepted

### Electric Cars
- Expensive
- Current infrastructure doesn't support electric vehicles
- Battery performance in weather/lifetime
- Range

### Self-Driving Cars
- Level 1 - Cruise Control
- Level 2 - Advanced Driving assist, lane assist, emergency braking, parking
- Level 3 - System can drive the car, but driver should be in seat with hands on the wheel
- Level 4 - Highly automatic, system can do what a regular driver can do but only in a limited area
- Level 5 - Fully automatic

#### Typical Problems
- Who is to blame in an accident
- Sucks in winter

### ChatGPT
- Still in development stage, although now driven by business
- Medical community
- Geoffrey Hinton - "Godfather of AI", leaves google and warns of dangers ahead
- All major players pursuing AI
- Should AI be regulated or not? 
- Over-reliance on AI models

### Generative AI Bias
- Google Gemini when asked for historical photos will only show pictures of non-white people, even Nazis were shown
- Legal issues
- Inherent bias, trusting them means you are accepting the tendencies of those who created them as truth

## Old days
- 13 years ago a student was talking about bitcoin
- 3 years ago one of the student's presentations was on GPT-3, predecessor to ChatGPT

## Historical Perspective
- Scientific approach was promoted by the Greeks

### Technology Advancements
- Technology can be used as a measuring point between civilizations
- If you have better technology, you have the better civilization
- Greek technology was adopted by Romans
- Romans defeated by Germanic tribes who didn't have the technology Rome had
- British had a problem with the Zulus
- French/American experience in Vietnam
- Ukraine army upscaling their tech vs the Russians who have quantity

## Technological Dependence
- Calculators have ruined math skills
- What happens if the electrical grid in NA collapses?
- LLMs will probably negate the need to write and program

## Y2K Bug
- Computers would break in 2000 because of the date change
- Society would shut down
- Farmers stocking ammunition to keep city people away
- Billions spent upgrading computers and creating backup plans
- 911 failed in large because of the backups

## Why New Tech isn't Adopted Immediately
- Sometimes the time isn't right
- Da Vinci invented prototypes for helicopters, tanks, and submarines that would have worked, just didn't have an engine
- Einstein Developed theories of Relativity and Special Relativity that weren't recognized for decades

## Religion
- Galileo Galilei - Persecuted the Catholic Church for promoting the idea that the Earth resolves around the sun
- Charles Darwin - Natural Selection
- Lamarckian Theory - Russian fell way behind Americans in biology and genetics

### Where Religion did help
- Guttenberg's printing press - printing bibles
- Crusades - lighter battle armor, castles, navigation

## Societal Considerations
- Group Think - Perception is more important than reality, Social media
- What might seem correct today might seem stupid to future generations - four humors
- Where does the term Ethernet come from

## Capital Considerations
- Sometimes technology is too expensive to pursue
- Nuclear power - largely because of lawyers, US can take 25 years to approve one
- Solar power - production is some of the most environmentally compromised places on earth
- Wind power - loud af, look ass
- Mars mission - expensive af

### Mars Direct
- The Martian is based on science
- Almost everything in the movie is based on science
- Can produce Methane fuel from the atmosphere on Mars
- Send an unmanned spacecraft to Mars to produce the fuel required for the return trip

## Who Prompt New Technological Development
- Military - Greek fire, light armor
- Napoleon remodeled the entire French school system so that students with an aptitude for science/engineering were directed to the military
- German Universities in the 1920s/30s were most advanced in the world, Hitler directed them to work on projects for the military

### Modern Military Development
- US Army - "We will always be outnumbered but never outgunned"

### Governments
- Soviet era science funded by the state, took advantage of captured German Scientists
- Americans and Soviets spent lots of money on the space race
- Chinese promoting science with super computers, genetic research, AI, and Education system

#### Problems
- Inconsistent funding, political will
- American super collider, cancelled due to political interference from other states
- Constellation program

#### Political Goals
- Ontario Provincial government tried to move towards wind power
- governments have too many lawyers

### Individual Accomplishments
- Scientists/artisans sponsored by patrons
- Glory - who is the first to develop something (Calculus)
- Fame - James Cameron, Elon Musk, Richard Branson
- Prize money

### Corporations
- Companies invest in R&D for their own benefits

## Evolutionary Technology
- Product performance can be described by an S curve on a graph that maps performance against Time/Engineering effort
- "Great Northeastern Movement" - charge more as performance increases

### Short vs Long Term Technologies
- Short term solves a problem but doesn't stick around

### Sustaining Evolutionary Technologies
- Companies tend to build upon strengths of existing products (Better production, finish, features)
- Incremental Technological improvements (Auto Industry, Semi-conductors, etc.)

### Characteristics of Evolutionary Technology
- Products stick around/have value
- Business is customer driven
- Incremental improvements over time

### Innovators Dilemma
- Book published in 1997
- Great firms can be complacent and have their lunch stolen by smaller, more agile firms

#### Disruptive Technology
- Does something in a completely different way
- Late to the game
- Compete with established product
- Large scale companies aren't good at it because they aren't open to a paradigm shift
- Start out less capable than the established products

#### Examples
##### Music

##### 'Power Shovels'
- Originally all were cable driven but were dangerous
- Hydraulic Excavators ('backhoes')
- Couldn't move as much dirt as the cable driven ones when introduced

### Value Network
- The context in which a firm identifies it's customer's needs, solves problems, procures inputs, reacts to competitors and strives for profits
- Tangible networks - anything associated with a monetary value in a company
- Intangible networks - knowledge and the benefits of it

### 5 Principles of Adoption
- Companies rely on Customers/Investors for resources - If a customer doesn't buy your product and you don't have another source of revenue, you have a problem
- Small markets don't provide the needs of large companies - as a company grows it needs to find a marketplace that can support it's growth
- Markets that don't exist can't be analyzed
- An organization's capabilities define it's disabilities - companies that experts in one area are less likely to invest in a new area, internally managers will direct resources to 'known winners'
- Technology supply might not equal market demand - Sustaining companies compete aggressively to obtain higher-margin profits

### Advantages and Disadvantages of New Companies
- Don't have to support existing products
- Don't risk alienating existing customers with the new tech
- Able to attract younger talent that is willing to do more for less
- less bureaucracy
- Disadvantages are no revenue stream and you need to attract investors

### More Examples
#### Steel
- 4 Levels

##### Integrated Mills
- Take iron core, coal, limestone and convert to steel using blast furnaces, cast machines and rolling mills

##### Mini Mills
- Use scrap metal as the intake
- Located anywhere there is a renewable supply of scrap metal
- Started off with bad quality, only good for rebar
- Integrated mills abandoned the rod/bar marketplace

#### Apple
- They tend to concentrate on existing markets
- focus on polished products
- The one time they tried to create a new market it almost sunk them

#### Amazon
- Started out with just books online
- Targeted towards the mass market instead of the technical oriented
- Made the transaction simple for customers
- Willing to lose money on new products for the chance to get a customer base (Ex. AWS)
- Lots of failures

#### Elon Musk
- Most visible CEO in history
