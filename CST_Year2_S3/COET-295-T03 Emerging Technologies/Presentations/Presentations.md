# Presentations
## Augmented Reality
- Members are Raven, Donny, Logan, Adam
- Combine real and virtual worlds in real time

### History
- Heads up display (HUD)
- Thought of the idea in WW2 cause pilots couldn't see well
- First developed in 1961
- First AR Device created in 1968 by Ivan Sutherland at Harvard, "Sword of Damocles", hanging from the ceiling

### Steve Mann
- Father of AR
- Published articles advocating for AR
- believed AR would give "self-empowerment"
- Had one of the first real world use cases - got hit by a car and the AR basically took a picture of the license plate

### Google Glasses
- Privacy concerns
- $1500
- Hands free, Wifi, Voice commands

### Current Development of AR
- Can be very low or high level
- Examples are Apple vision pro, Samsung XR, Meta Orion, Magic Leap 2
- Magic Leap 2 is more built for industry and manufacturing things

### Current Use Cases
- Most are unavailable to the public cause they are so expensive
- Some consumer products support it at more affordable prices (Ex. Meta Quest, most modern Smartphones)
- Phone apps like Pokemon Go and Snapchat

### Potential Disruptions of AR
- Online Retailers to let you visual things like furniture in your house or nail polish on your nails
- 19.8% higher purchasing session
- Likely to increase "halo-buying effect"

### Lost Sales from Digital Divide
- Online retailing set to double in 2030
- Not having an online presence is a liability

### New Phone?
- Phones are pretty knew
- Mark Zuckerberg believes AR will be the phone killer
- Meta, Microsoft and Google all have products meant to compete with phones as AR devices

### Education
- Correct trend from tiktok attention span?
- Reinforce post secondary education
- Interactive and visual learning

### Challenges and Limitations
#### Hardware
- Apple Vision Pro has really short battery life
- Weight of a lot of these devices is a lot (600 - 650 grams)
- Displays can struggle in bright rooms

#### Social Acceptance
- People don't like you wearing this in person
- Some public places have banned them
- Built in cameras are a concern
- Need for designs that look like everyday accessories - where do you draw the line?

#### Ethical and Privacy Concerns
- Typically collect a lot of data
- Users are often unaware of what is being tracked
- Risk of data misuse/breaches

#### Safety
- Reports of people wearing them while driving or crossing the street
- Lose spatial awareness
- Constant information - can lead to social awkwardness, stress or fatigue
- Eye strain and visual impairment

### Conclusion
- Potential to change the world
- Depends on the world's views on ethics and the ability for the technology to integrate into society as a whole

## Quantum Encryption
- Members are Doug, Seth, Anuj and Aron

### RSA
- Easy for computers to multiply two large numbers together but hard to reverse, so it's easy to decrypt if you know part of the equation but hard if you don't

### Grover's Algorithm
- Unstructured search
- O(n) becomes O(root(n))
- Need longer key lengths to get the same level of security

### Shor's Algorithm
- Integer Factorization and discrete logarithms problems
- Breaks mathematical assumptions that underlie most public/private key infrastructure

### Harvest now, Decrypt Later
- If we were an organization, how relevant is our data will be taken
- In 2016, China Telecom diverted traffic between Canada and Korean government networks
- Internet traffic meant for Cloudflare was routed through Russia

### Ways Data can be Hijacked
- Exploiting Border Gateway Protocol
- Not necessarily be malicious
- Works because two routers will trust one another implicitely

### Solution
- Post-Quantum Cryptography

#### Quantum Cryptogoraphy
- Uses fancy physics
- Ex. Quantum Key Distribution

#### Post-Quantum Cryptography
- battles against classic and quantum computers decrypting stuff

##### Pros
- No quantum hardware required
- Interoperable with internet protocols
- Standardized by NIST

##### Cons
- Requires larger key sizes and signatures
- Increased computation costs

##### Risk of Late Implementation
- Future data breaches - data captured now can be decrypted later
- Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Vulnerability

##### Modern Implementations
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized it
- Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
- Final draft underwent a rename from CRYSTALS-Kyber and Dilithium

### Timeline
- Tuta - Encrypted Email
- iMessage and Signal - Encrypted messaging
- FIDO2 - Security Key prototype (2FA)
- Apple

### Implementations
- Hybrid - uses both RSA/ECC and NIST standard algorithms
- If there was a good enough quantum computer right now it would break everything

### Conclusion
- If we're dealing with a quantum threat in our organization we should ask some questions
- How long do you need your data to be secure
- Does the data need to be confidential forever
- How far will quantum computing come in the next 5, 10 or 15 years

## 3D Printing


## Agentic AI
- Members are Kim, Chau, Patreece and John

### What is it?
- AI that can solve complex multi step problems
- Started with basic LLM chatbots and assistants that evolved

### Four Steps
- Perceive - Gather data from variety of sources
- Reason - retrieve the data for when it's ready to act
- Act - uses tools to execute tasks
- Learn - takes data from interaction to enhance future models

### What does it enable
- Browsing
- Form-filling
- Document editing
- Automation of desktop workflows
- Customer Support
- Write code, fix bugs, automate software tasks
- Financial applications such as fraud detection and market analysis
- Supply chain and logistics - track shipments, forecast demand, etc.
- Cybersecurity - Identify, prioritize and mitigate threats
- Healthcare - Generate documentation, support diagnosis and interact with patients
- Conversational - Voice chat, interact with calendars
- Autonomous Vehicles - stop, change lanes, accelerate, slow down

### Replacements
- 'Human on computer tasks'
- An AI system that can help you do anything a human does on a computer
- Difficult to pinpoint a single industry
- Jobs - Altered role definition, technological growth, societal advancement long term, layoffs and restructuring short term

### The Future
- Increased efficiency and productivity
- Easy access to information

### Limitations
- AI can be expensive
- Training and fine-tuning
- Debugging difficulties
- Information is usually generic, incomplete recommendations and lack of personalization

### Reduced Operational Costs
- Reduced labor costs

### Improved Reliability and Adoption
- AI with logic

### Conclusion
- Significant evolution in AI
- Can be beneficial by enhancing workflow
- Can cause employment problems
- Companies will still need good employees to balance it out
