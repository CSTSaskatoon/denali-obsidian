# Python Setup
1. Download [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows) from Jetbrains
2. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (I got `1.13.3`)
3. Create a new project in Pycharm wherever you want
4. Click hamburger menu top left -> Settings -> Project: `PROJECT_NAME` -> Python Interpreter -> Make sure an interpreter is listed. If one isn't, try re-installing Python
