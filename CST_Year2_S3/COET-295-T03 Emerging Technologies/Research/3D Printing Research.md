# 3D Printing Research
## Availability
- Availability, storage and cost of spare parts for products are the main barriers to product repair.
- If you can 3D Print the part, then you don't need to purchase it from the original seller
- 3D Printing for Repair article coins the acronym '3DPfR', meaning '3D Printing for Repair'
- European Commission implemented acts to ensure availability of spare parts for consumer products for a longer time
- Because of the Right to Repair Act, Manufacturers need to find cost-effective ways to store the spare parts for older products
- Instead of storing a bunch of spare parts, the manufacturers and consumers could instead 3D print the parts on demand.

## Manufacturer Costs
- Save on storage, repair costs, labor costs, material use and transportation
- In [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527318303785) study, manufacturing experts estimated that 2 to 75 percent of their products could be acceptably manufactured with 3D printing, but most stayed around 5 to 10 percent.

## Potential Industries
- Aerospace
- Automotive
- Machine tool production

## Design Flexibility
- Since everything is done in software and you can stop a print at any time, whenever you have a revision to a design you can simply make the change and start printing it right away, which makes prototyping and iterative design simple
- Gives the ability to modify and update parts after original production has ceased

## Self Repair by Customers
- In [this](https://researchrepository.ul.ie/articles/conference_contribution/Opportunities_for_3D-printable_spare_parts_estimations_from_historical_data/19867540/1?file=35284414) paper, they found that 7.5 to 29 percent of items at 'repair cafes' could benefit from 3D printed parts
