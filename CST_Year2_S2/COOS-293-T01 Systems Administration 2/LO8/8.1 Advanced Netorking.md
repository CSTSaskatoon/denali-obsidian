# Advanced Networking
## Receive Side Scaling (RSS)
- When your traffic starts to exceeds your single processor's power
- segregates/delivers network streams across multiple processors
- Like multithreading
- Like if you add another lane on a highway

### What is it?
- Allows the network to distribute packets across multiple processors/cores
- Reduces latency
- Improved scalability
- Dynamic load balancing
- Improved cache locality
- Support for scaling on large servers with more than 64 processors, as well as multi-NUMA node servers

### Purpose
- Prevent a single processor from being a bottleneck

### Hashing
- Take a hash of one of the pieces of the packet (typically the header)
- Area can be non-contiguous
- Used to find which packets go to which processor
- Done at the network card, most cards nowadays have a specific chip to help them do it fast

### Miniport Driver
- Schedules received **Deferred Procedure Calls** (**DPC**)
- Manages queues
- Hashing and CPU assignment

## Receive Segment Coalescing (RSC)
- Reduces CPU utilization for network processing on the receive side by offloading tasks from the host CPU to the NIC hardware
- Allows the NIC to coalesce or combine multiple TCP segments into one larger segment
- Reduces the number of interrupts and header processing that the host CPU needs to perform
- Like if you put a bunch of people on a bus to save space on the highway

### Benefits
- Reduces CPU utilization for receive-intensive workloads
- Improved performance and scalability by allowing servers to effectively service a larger number of clients
- Seamless integration with virtualized environments

## Data Center Bridging (DCB)
- Hardware Queue-based bandwidth management
- Relies on support by servers and their switches
- Uses **Class of Service** (CoS) **tags** to control traffic
- Facilitates dedicated traffic flows
- Management is facilitated by tagging types of traffic with tags which represent priority (Ex. VOIP vs FTP packets)
- Like specific lights on a traffic stop to let emergency vehicles through while everyone else is stopped

### What is It?
- Enables **Converged Fabrics** in the data center, where the storage, data networking, cluster IPC and management traffic all share the same Ethernet infrastructure
- Hardware based bandwidth to allocate a specific type of traffic to have different priority
- Essential if the upper layer protocol such as a fiber channel assumes a lossless underlying transport

## Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)
- Skip all the bs and go straight from application to the NIC (bypass host CPU and OS)
- Not all NICs support it
- Some storage systems also work with it

## NIC Teaming
- Use multiple network cards and make them act like one network card
- NIC processors continue to operate independently

### Benefits
- Failover
- Load balancing
- Bandwidth-aggregation

### Modes
- **Switch Independent** - All NICs are connected to different switches, OS handles distribution
- **Switch Dependent** - All network adapters connected to the same switch, distribution handling done with LACP or other protocol, provides a single interface with combined bandwidth

### Microsoft Load Balancing Failover (LBFO)
- NIC teaming on **Windows Server**
- Supports up to 32 NICs (No hardware match required)
- Has the same two teaming modes

### Switch Embedded Teaming (SET)
- Newer **Windows Server** NIC Teaming technology
- **Virtualization aware** (with Hyper-V)
- improved performance and compatibility over LBFO
- Needs uniform adapters (same hardware)
- Can use teaming at the physical layer and SET at the virtual layer if you have non-uniform adapters
- Has to be done via PowerShell
- *Only supports Switch Independent Mode*

## Server Message Block (SMB)
- Storage virtualization to separate storage management and presentation from underlying hardware
- Only used by Windows, Unix and Linux use Network File Share (**NFS**) which is faster but not as many features
- Can use NFS on Windows

### Benefits
- Transparent Failover
- Scale-out file servers
- Direct (RDMA network adapters)
- SQL Server over SMB
- Multichannel
- Encryption, signing, and pre-auth integrity
- SMB over Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) (Only good if you have a low-loss network)
- Storage Replica (typically volume level)
- Storage Spaces Direct
- Storage QoS

## Hyper-V Virtual Switch
- Software based L2 ethernet switch
- ARP/ND poisoning protection
- DHCP Guard and Router Guard
- Port Mirroring
- Network Traffic Monitoring
- Diagnostics
- IPSec Task Offloading
- Port ACLs (MAC or IP)
- Trunk Mode - configure VM as virtual appliance and send all traffic through them
- Isolated VLAN
- Bandwidth Limits
- Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)

### Extensions
- Adding more features via software
- **Virtual Filtering Platform (VFP) Forwarding** - core building block of **Software Defined Networking**
- **Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS)**

#### Software Defined Networking
- Provision virtual appliances that deliver functionality equivalent to hardware-based network devices
- Control how the **network devices work at the software level**
- Ex. Load Balancing, NAT, Firewall, RAS, or Gateway

### Virtual Receiver Side Scaling (vRSS)
- extends **RSS support to virtual workloads** (VMs)
- Can only use the processors/cores assigned to that VM
- Relies on RSS support on vNIC

### Virtual Machine Queue (VMQ)
- Target a NIC with an individual core (**one VM NIC adapter per core**)
- Incompatible with RSS/vRSS
- Association between vNICs and CPU cores is static

#### Dynamic VMQ
- Dynamic updates to assignments of a physical network adapter queue to a processor
- Uses vRSS

### Virtual Machine Multi-Queue (VMMQ)
- Multiple queues can be assigned to a single VM, each queue assigned to a specific core on the VM
- Uses Embedded Ethernet switch in physical NICs (Not all NICs can do this)
- Reduces burden on host CPU, increases load on NICs

#### Dynamic VMMQ
- this exists
- packet coalescing (like RSC)
- "Queue Parking" - pre-allocated specific queues for idle workloads

### Receiver Segment Coalescing (RSC)
- Same as normal RSC except it's on the Virtual Switch

### Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)
- Take one physical NIC and make it look like many different NICs
- Bypasses the Hyper-V Virtualization stack

## Quality of Service (QoS)
- Ensuring you have enough bandwidth to let high-priority stuff through (Ex. VOIP packets)
- Can also do it for storage services using *Cluster Shared Volumes* or *Scale Out File Server*
- Can throttle services
- Can also do it for **Software Defined Networks**
