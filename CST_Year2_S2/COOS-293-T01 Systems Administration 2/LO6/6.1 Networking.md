## Network Policy Server (NPS) Policies
### Connection Request Policy
- establishes sets of conditions and settings for which RADIUS servers perform auth
- Can use this as a RADIUS server or RADIUS proxy based on the time of day and day of the week, realm name in connection request, connection type being requested and the client's IP

### Network Policies
- Establishes sets of conditions, constraints and settings that specify who is authorized to connect
- Each has four properties: **Overview, Conditions, Constraints, Settings**

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- Verify and authenticate the identity of each party
- Encryption
- Types of certifications: **Self-Signed**, **Internal Private Certificate Authority**, **External Public Certificate Authority**

## Routing and Network Address Translation (NAT)
- **Routing and Remote Access (RRAS)** is software based router
- Can route LAN-to-LAN, LAN-to-WAN (not recommended), demand-dial, and NAT traffic
- Supports static routes (IPv4/IPv6), IGMP, RIP, NAT

### IPv4 and IPv6 Routing
- **Routing** is the process of selecting paths in a network where data will be sent
- Required to send traffic to another subnet
- Computer can act as a router and include it's own routing table
	- Lists of routes for a particular network
- **Routing metric** - "cost", shortest weighted path
- Routers operate at the OSI reference model layer 3 (network layer)
- Layer 2 **switches**
- Layer 3 switches can perform layer 2 switching but also perform routing base don P addresses in an organization
	- Can't be used for connecting WAN connections (Only local networks)

### Remote Access Role
- **Remote Access (dial up or VPN)** - sets up the server to accept incoming RA connections
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)** - Provide NAT services to clients on the private network
- **Virtual Private Network (VPN) access and NAT** - Support incoming VPN and NAT
- **Secure Connection between private networks** - demand dial or persistent network
- **Custom Configuration**

### Configure Routing
- **Static Routes** - bad for security, but good for small single paths that don't change
- **Dynamic Routes** - created by Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
- When the packet reaches the local router then uses it's routing table to determine the next hop

## Web App Proxy
- Reverse Proxy (funnels all public requests down to one server)
- Located in a perimeter network

### Authentication Options
- Workplace Join - devices that aren't part of the AD domain
- SSO - pre-auth credentials once
- Multifactor Authentication
- Multifactor Access Control - Authorization claim rules, permit or deny claims 

### Azure AD Application Proxy
- Secure access to on-prem web apps

## VPNs
### Scenarios
- Secure point-to-point connection by using a public network such as the internet

### Implementation
- **Encapsulation** - private data goes in a packet with header containing routing information
- **Authentication** - Proves identity of user/computer trying to connect
- **Data Encryption** - Data remains private by encrypting it prior to transmission
- **Data Integrity** - Verifies data sent over VPN connection has not been modified

### Protocols
#### L2TP
- **L2TP** - mutually authenticate with **IPSec**
- User's auth happens
- L2TP is tunnel, IPSec is encryption
- Industry standard
- Can use pre-shared keys or certificates
- IPSec provides confidentiality, integrity, data authentication, mutual authentication, anti-replay and non-repudiation

#### SSTP
- Sends traffic through `SSL` v3 channel like `HTTPS`
- Uses standard 443 port so goes through most firewalls, NATs and proxies
- Support for strong auth methods, transport-level security with enhanced key negotiation, encryption and integrity checking
- Works over IPv4 and IPv6
- Mostly Windows but some variations in Linux
- Doesn't support site-to-site
- Supports user auth only (using PPP)

##### Advantages
- Decent encryption
- Easy to configure platforms it's built into
- Difficult to block cause port 443
- Good speeds

##### Disadvantages
- Closed source and solely owned by Microsoft
- Available on a limited number of platforms
- Could be dropped if the admin spots SSTP headers (which is not really relevant because they can block any protocol)

#### Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
- Different kind of animal
- Three protocols - **IPSec**, **Encapsulation**, **IKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming**
- Really designed for computer to computer
- Good for moving from 1 wireless AP to another due to the **IKEv2 reconnection feature**
- Uses certificates
- Faster than other protocols
- Well suited for **mobile**
- Has built-in **NAT Transversal** (NAT-T) functionality for compatibility between vendors (knows how to deal with NAT)
- Has built in health check
- Supports traffic selectors to control what traffic can access the tunnel

##### Advantages
- Supports high-end ciphers
- Fast
- Easily resist network changes and automatically dropped connections
- natively available on BlackBerry
- Simple to set up
- Good for site-to-site

##### Disadvantages
- Only uses UDP port 500, firewall or admin could block it
- Doesn't offer cross-platform compatibility like other protocols

#### Summary Of Protocols

### VPN Reconnect and App-Triggered VPN
- VPN reconnect needs `IKEv2`
- App-triggered VPN connects VPN client when a specific app starts, requires split tunneling for VPN profile
- Split tunneling lets some of your network traffic to bypass the VPN

### Profiles
- Predefined configuration settings applied to VPN clients
- Created with CMAK or other tools
- Executable file distributed by VPN clients
- Can be deployed using OS Image, Group Policies, Automated software distribution tools, or manual installation

## Authentication Protocols
- **PAP** - Plain text passwords, don't use this
- **CHAP** - Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol, uses MD5 hashes to validate (which isn't super strong), and can impersonate the server
- **MS-CHAPv2** - made by Microsoft, stronger security than CHAP but still has encryption issues, mutual authentication
- **EAP** - Extensible Authentication Protocol, Not a true authentication protocol, just a framework, Strongest security and most flexibility in vendors but requires higher level gathering of information

### CHAP and CHAPv2 Flaws
- Use DES which has been broken
- CHAP is a "smoke and mirrors" protocol
- In the newer version of Windows they don't really use either, instead use EAP
