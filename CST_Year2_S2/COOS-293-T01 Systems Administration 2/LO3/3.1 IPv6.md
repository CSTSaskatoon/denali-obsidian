# IPv6

## IPv4 Fragmentation
- Basically when you take a packet that is too large for the network, the router will break the packet into many smaller packets that can be reassembled on the other side
- Only the actual data is fragmented not the whole packet
- If one of the fragmented packets is lost it has to resend everything not just the one part
- Might get blocked by NAT or firewalls if not done after them

Fragmentation can happen on IPv6 but it has to be done by the host
- Server sends back message to host that then has to resend the packets at smaller sizes
- Not really fragmentation since it's being done on the host machine

**Fragmentation is functional but not desirable**

## Benefits of IPv6
- Hierarchical addressing and routing
- The need for simpler configuration - stateless, don't need DHCP to build your own address
- The requirement for security at the IP layer - doesn't have encryption built in but works well with it
- The need for better support for real-time delivery of data (Quality of Service)

## Host Addresses
- 128 bits long and arranged into 8 groups, each 16 bits
- Each group is expressed as 4 hexadecimal digits and groups are separated by colons

Use the Neighbor Discover protocol to automatically generate their own node component
- automatically generates the node component based on the MAC or EUI-64 address of the host's interface
- EUI-64 splits a 48-bit hardware address into two 24-bit parts, inserting the 16-bit `0xFFFE` code between them, and invert the 7th bit, resulting in a 64-bit interface identifier
- If this process fails it doesn't retry because it will generate the same thing every time

## Addressing Types
- **Unicast** - only sending to one address
- **Broadcast** - send to all addresses (uses multicast instead on IPv6)
- **Multicast** - send to select addresses
- **Anycast** - sends to addresses in a list until one of them responds

## Types of Addresses
- **Global Unicast** - similar to public IPv4 addresses, prefix of `2000::/3`
- **Unique Local** - similar to private IPv4 addresses, prefix of `FD00::/8`
- **Link Local** - used for sending packets over the local subnet, routers don't forward these, basically a IPv4 APPIPA address, prefix of `FE80::/10`
- **Loopback** - `::1`

### Global
- Routable on IPv6 internet
- Allocate 16 bits for internal subnetting
- begin with 2 or 3 (`2000::/3`)

### Unique Local
- Equivalent of IPv4 private addresses
- Require organization ID to be randomly generated
- Allocate remaining 16 bits for subnetting

### Link Local
- Automatically generated on all IPv6 hosts
- Similar to IPv4 APIPA addresses
- Sometimes used in place of IPv4 broadcasts
- Include a zone ID that identifies the interface

## Configuration
### Autoconfiguration
#### Stateless Autoconfiguration
- based on receipt of Router Advertisement messages and includes a router prefix but not additional configuration options such as DNS servers

#### Stateful Autoconfiguration
- Protocols such as DHCPv6
- Uses this when Router Advertisements instruct it to, or the local link has no routers

#### Steps
1. create a link local address
2. host sends a Neighbor Solicitation message to the address created in the first phase - if the address is already in use, the host stops the configuration process and needs to be manually configured instead
3. host sends router solicitation message

#### States
- Network interface changes states during autoconfiguration
- defines the life cycle of IPv6 addresses
- **Tentative** - host goes through verification process to make sure the address is unique
- **Valid** - address has been verified to be unique
- **Preferred** - enables network interface to send and receive unicast traffic
- **Deprecated** - use of the address for new communication is discouraged although the address is still valid
- **Invalid** - address no longer allows a network interface to send or receive unicast traffic

## DHCPv6
- Supported in Windows Server 2022 by default
- Can configure DHCP by creating IPv6 scopes
- Doesn't really look at IPv4 and IPv6 differently

## Router Advertisements and site prefixes
- Routers periodically multicast router advertisement messages
- announce their availability and convey information for other machines to autoconfigure
