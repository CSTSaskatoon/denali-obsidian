# Branch Office Networking
## Considerations
- Network Security
- Physical Security
- Availability and Reliability
- Performance
- Legal and regulatory requirements (offices in different regions/countries)
- IT Organization (location of resources/tech support)

## Options for Providing Connectivity
- **WAN technologies** - Dedicated Links, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks, VPNs
- **WAN link topologies** - Hub and Spoke, Mesh
- **Windows Server 2022** networking technologies - Remote Access Role, VPN (adds encryption)

## AD DS, DNS and DHCP Services
### Service Placement
- Main office only - Central management
- Main office and branch offices - more hardware/tech support/replication

### Read only Domain Controllers
- **Credential caching** (slow/unsecure WAN) - only cached credentials are lost if RODC is compromised
- **Administrative Role Separation** - use an account separate from account managing writeable DC servers

## File and Print Services
- **Distributed File System (DFS)** is a set of technologies that enable Windows Server to organize multiple SMB file shares into a distributed file system
- **`BranchCache`** fetches the contents of a file server at the main office and caches it on a server or client computer in the branch office

### Print Services
- Basic service needed by most enterprise organizations
- Large printer network is typically available in a large organization
- Recommended that print servers are published in AD DS
- Benefit of local print servers at a branch is that no network outside the branch is used
- **Branch Office Direct Printing** - don't need to send print job to main office and back, no need for print server availability

## Distributed File Systems (DFS)
- Basically you got a bunch of SMB shares and this makes them accessible anywhere in the organization no matter what office the share is
- location is transparent to users (they just see it as one server)
- Redundancy
- Performance
- DFS namespace enables you to group shared folders into a single structure

### What is it
- Namespace - enables you to group shared folders into a single logical structure
- Replication (DFSR) - optional, replicate folders between servers

#### Diagram

### Namespace Components
- Namespace server
- Namespace root (technically a share), has pointers to targets (which are shares on other servers)
- Folder
- Folder Targets

### DFSR
- Replication
- Multi-master (data can be modified on each each server which then replicates it to other servers)
- Have to create replication groups which contains members (which are servers)
- One server can be in multiple replication groups
- Have to specify what folders on the servers are replicated
- **DFS and DFSR are the same thing except that suddenly it's DFSR if you are sharing the same folder on more than one server**

#### Functionality
- **File Change Detection** - detects volume changes using the file system *update sequence number* (USN) journal and only replicates changes after it's closed
- **Conflict Resolution** - last writer wins for update conflicts, earliest creator wins for name conflicts

#### Replication Scheduling
- can have one bandwidth during business hours and another for non-business hours

#### Remote Differential Compression
- Only sends the piece of the file that changed instead of the whole thing
- Has it's own compression algorithm
- When there's a new file the whole thing needs to be replicated (obviously)

### Staging
- **File change detection**
- Sends less than 1KB per file across the network to sync metadata
- Staging folder accts as cache for new and changed files that need to be replicated
- Also used to compress files to be sent
- When received on the other end, it's used to decompress the file and install it on the replicated folder
- Each replicated folder has it's own staging folder
- **4.096MB** by default
- When it's 90% full it purges until it's at 60%
- Doesn't determine the largest file, will process the file and then do cleanup/removal after

### Conflict Resolution
- Last writer wins
- Losing file is renamed and stored in the **Conflict and Deleted** folder
- **660MB** by default (might also be 4096MB now)
- Information logged into XML file
- Only accessible by admin
- "last resort"

### Namespaces
#### Domain Based
- Creates namespace in AD, replicated to all AD servers
- Access namespaces by using domain name
- If you change the name of a server, namespace is unaffected
- Preferred method

#### Standalone
- Doesn't require AD
- Access namespace by server URL
- Single point of failure

### Referrals
- Ordered list of servers/targets that a client receives from a domain controller or namespace server
- After a computer receives a referral, it reaches the first server on the list
- If the server isn't available it goes to the next one
- Basically "**which of these servers is preferred?**"

### Optimize Namespaces
- Renaming/moving a folder
- Specifying referral cache duration
- Ordering method for targets in referrals
- Access based enumeration (Only see what you have access to)
- Permissions inheritance
- Namespace polling
- Modifying replication technology
- Data de-duplication

### Are DFS Type Systems Important
- They are good for handling big/high throughput data

### Manage DFS Databases
- Assign appropriate permissions
- Disable referral when doing maintenance
- Remove server from folder's target referral
- Once maintenance is complete, configure referral to include the server again
- If the database becomes corrupted, DFSR will detect it and rebuild the database
- Once the database is rebuilt, each file will be marked with a normal replicated state
- Files located in `ConflictAndDeleted` and `Preexisting` can be restored only from backup
- Before restoring files need to run `Restore-DfsrPreservedFiles` to allow recovery of files form these folders

### Monitor/Troubleshoot DFS
- Health Report
- Propagation Report
- Propagation Test
- Verify Topology
- `Dfsrdiag.exe`
- PowerShell
- Performance Monitor

### Common DFS Issues
- Namespace folder not accessible by entire organization
- Namespace folder accessible to limited number of employees
- Performance Issues
- Replication Latency
- Antivirus software
- Network Connectivity
- Replication Backlog
- Force Replication
- Primary DC Name

#### Verify Replication Settings
- Enable Replication and RDC
- Replication Schedule
- Bandwidth Throttling
- Staging Quota (How much storage the staging folder uses)

### DFS Security (Not in the textbook)
- Should secure folders with NTFS permissions instead of share permissions because it gives you more control
- need to sync permissions between servers if you're doing replication

#### Authentication/Access Control
- Use Active Directory or Kerberos where possible
- Multi factor Auth
- ACL for granular control
- Consider using isolated VLANs

#### Data Encryption
- Data at **rest** using BitLocker or EFS
- Data in **transit** using SMB Encryption or TLS
- Secure **VPNs** for traffic

#### Namespace and Replication
- Disable unused DFS features
- Use read-only replication
- monitor logs

#### Auditing and Monitoring
- Enable auditing

#### Network Security
- Restrict ports
- Isolate traffic using VLANs or subnets
- IDS and IPS

#### Patch Management and Hardening
- Update DFS servers
- disable SMBv1, use SMBv3
- Harden server OS by disabling unnecessary services

#### Disaster Recovery and Backups
- Maintain regular encrypted backups
- Test recovery plans
- Use geo-redundant storage for failover

## BranchCache
- Take a server and place it at the branch office
- Whenever a user needs a file, the server "gets a copy of the file" (not really), and when somebody else asks for the file the server still has it cached
- Big difference between normal network caching is security

### Configuration
- Branch offices often have slow connectivity to the central office and have limited infrastructure for security
- When users access files over slow WAN links there is a delay, especially when accessing large files
- When using BranchCache you are basically accelerating the process
- Everything is encrypted

### Installing
- Have to get the feature on all servers using it
- Configure it with GPO and enable it for a shared folder (this is where you choose what you are caching)
- Have to configure a **hash publication** (how you tell everyone what files are available)
- For the clients, you have to configure it using Group Policy of `netsh`

### What is it?
- optimizes network usage between branch offices and central office
- Supports SSL, SMB signing and end-to-end IPsec

### Process Phases
- Request Content
- Locate Content
- Retrieve Content

### Requirements
- OS (Server 2012+ and Windows 8+)
- AD DS (for GPOs)
- AD Sites - used as boundaries
- WSUS Server - Only if you control your own updates
- Firewall for HTTP and WS-Discovery if using distributed or hosted cache mode

### Modes
#### Distributed
- Each client computer caches content locally
- Well suited for small branch offices
- Allows deployment of BranchCache without additional hardware
- Don't have a server to do the caching
- use multicast protocol called WS-Discovery to search in the same AD Site for a computer that has the cached content
- Will never go across subnets

#### Hosted
- Centralized caching server
- Use GPO to configure client computers to connect to the FQDN of the hosted cache servers

### Special Considerations
- Hash publication is required to let clients know if you have the file cached or not
- Put all BranchCache servers in one OU so it's easier to manage group policies

#### Hash Cache
- Stores hash of the content on the server
- Hashes are small
- Easy to compare

#### Data Cache
- Where the actual file is

### Pre-hash and preload content on servers
- Identify what folders you want stored on the BranchCache server

### Client Settings
- Create and configure Group Policy
- Select Mode

### Troubleshooting
- See how long it takes to get a remote file vs cached file
- `netsh branchcache` or PowerShell cmdlet `Get-BCStatus`
- Verify BranchCache is running
- Check group policies
- Check ports are open
- Test server connectivity
- Clear the cache
- Event logs
- Performance Monitor

### Monitoring
- `Get-BCStatus`
- `Netsh branchcache shows status all`
- Event Viewer
- Performance Monitor counters
