# Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
Give out IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateway, DNS, etc.
Platform independent protocol based on broadcast traffic
To communicate on a network, devices need valid TCP/IP configurations
A device can contain TCP/IP settings automatically, in which case the address is dynamic
You can also configure the settings manually, in which case the IP is static and doesn't change unless you configure a different value

## Benefits
Saves you work because it gives addresses automatically
Gives the correct settings (less prone to error)
Updates client TCP/IP settings automatically
Minimal administration, not dependent on the number of devices

**DORA**
- Discover
- Offer
- Request
- Acknowledge (Contains other settings such as DNS, subnet mask, default gateway, etc.)
- Server could send a **Not Acknowledge** (NACK) if it changes it's mind, in which case you start over

## Renewal
IP isn't given to you forever
DHCP gives you a time when you will need to renew by, usually renew after lease is 50% done, and 87.5% if the first one fails.
Server could respond with a Not Acknowledge
If the server still doesn't respond, it tries to discover other DHCP servers
If it still can't find one with DORA, it gets an APPIPA address

When a PC turns on, it tries to renew the address. If it can't find the DHCP it tries to go to the gateway to see if the address is valid
Can manually renew or release your IP with
```PowerShell
ipconfig /[renew|release]
```

## Installing a DHCP
DHCP should have a static IP
Authorization
- When you find a DHCP you want to make sure it's good
- Done with AD DS on Windows Server
- Doesn't stop malicious people, just prevents Admins from making small accidents
- Only works on Windows

## Allocate IPv4 Addresses
Scope - Pool of IP addresses and other options the DHCP manages
Zone - Not used on DHCP, only DNS

Required
- Range of IP addresses
- Subnet mask
- Lease Duration

Optional (But probably should)
- Default gateway addresses
- DNS server and suffix
- Other network options

Addresses can be reserved based on MAC address

### Leases
Temporary Assignment
Length depends on business needs
Longer lease
- Renew less
- Less contacting the DHCP
- Smaller pool of addresses
- Good for things where you have the same devices (Ex. office)

Shorter Lease
- Renew more
- More load on the DHCP
- Bigger pool of addresses
- Good if lots of different devices are connecting for a short amount of time (Ex. Coffee shop)

### Reservations and Exclusions
Reservation is one IP address for one specific machine, based on MAC
- Can't be given to other machines even if the pool is full

Exclusion is taking some of the addresses out of the pool and saying "Don't use these"
- Can begin the address pool at like 20 to have the first 18 addresses hard coded as static addresses on servers (Like doing reservations but you're doing it on the machine instead)

## DHCP Options
DHCP does more than just lease addresses
Simple rule is the closer to the IP address the more weight it holds (Reservation overrides Scope and Server settings)
Server you can configure generic settings everyone will use (Ex. DNS address)
If the machine doesn't understand the option given to it, it just ignores it

## Multicast Scopes
packets are sent from one host to multiple hosts

## DHCP Policies
Granular control of scopes
Options can be configured at scope or inherited server-wide
**User Classes** assign DHCP options to a group of clients that require similar configuration
**Vendor Classes** assign vendor-specific options to clients that share a common vendor type (Ex. Dell computers)

Examples
- Different IP ranges within the subnet
- shorter lease durations for mobile computers
- control who gets access to your network based on MAC
- Must have clients set to know what "class" they are
	- `ipconfig /setclassid ethernet "testuserclass"`

## PXE Boot
**Pre-boot Execution Environment**
Boot from a server over the network

## DHCP Relay Agent
any TCP/IP host which is used to forward requests and replies between DHCP and client when the server is on a different network
often implemented in large enterprise networks where the DHCP is located on a different network segment

## High Availability for DHCP
**Split Scopes** - two DHCP servers, 80% of addresses on primary server, 20% on secondary server
**Server Cluster** - Uses failover cluster to host the server
**DHCP failover** - Replicates lease info between two DHCP servers
**Standby Server** - Uses hot standby DHCP server with identical scopes and options as production server

### DHCP Failover
Failover relationships must have the same name
Configured with hot standby or load balancing

Maximum Client Load Time (MCLT) determines when the failover partner assumes control
