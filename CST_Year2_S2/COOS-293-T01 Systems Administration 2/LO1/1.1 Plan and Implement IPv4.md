# Plan and Implement IPv4
## Settings for IPv4
Every computer or device that connects to a network needs an IP address configured
IPv4 Address consists of four numbers, represented in dotted decimal notation (Ex. 192.168.10.0)

A subnet mask lets you separate groups of IPv4 addresses

## Default Gateway
By default, computers can only communicate with each other on the same network ID (same subnet)
a default gateway which is a router or Layer 3 switch on a TCP/IP network, forwards IP packets to other networks
has multiple network adapters each with it's own IP address, so that one subnet's computer can communicate with a subnet on another computer
The multiple internal networks of an organization is an Intranet

## Public and Private addresses
Public
- Required by devices and hosts that connect directly to the internet
- Must be globally unique
- Routable on the internet
- must be assigned by IANA/RIR

Private
- Not routable on the internet
	- 10.0.0.0/8
	- 172.16.0.0/12
	- 192.168.0.0/16
	- 169.254.0.0/16 - APIPPA
- Can be locally assigned by an organization
- Must be translated to access the internet
