# IPv4 Troubleshooting
## Routing
incoming and outgoing traffic, delivering traffic to it's intended destination
Routers send traffic to destination based on a set of data called routing tables

Routing tables contain this information about a route for a specific interface
- Network Destination
- Netmask
- Gateway
- Interface
- Metric

#### To see a routing table on your computer
1. Open `cmd`
2. run `route print`

can modify it using PowerShell
```PowerShell
# Ex. Get-NetRoute, New-NetRoute, Set-NetRoute
Get-NetRoute -AddressFamily IPv4

# Add Route in cmd
route add 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 192.168.0 -P # (Persistent)
```

- Who is affected? (Scope)
- Which networking functionalities have issues and which functionalities are operational
