# Name Resolution with DNS
## Name Resolution Process
- Hostname - computer added to a domain name and top-level domain to make a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
- NetBIOS names used to be used by Windows but is now deprecated
- Uses recursive and iterative queries to resolve names
- Humans find it easier to remember names
- Computers like addressing with numbers
- IP addresses can change
- DNS updates the link between resource name and IP address each time the address changes
- DNS server uses a database structure to store names and corresponding IPs

## Components
Naming structure = DNS Namespace
- Organized hierarchically
- Ex. `computer01.unitedstates.microsoft.com`

Components include
- Server
- Zone (Forward and reverse lookup zones) - namespace
- Forwarder - DNS sends all queries it can't resolve to another DNS
- Delegation - Delegates a part of a namespace hosted on your DNS to another DNS
- Clients/resolvers - client sends DNS queries to DNS servers
- Resource Records - what takes the words and turns them into IP addresses

## How a DNS resolves names on the internet
There are 13 root server clusters that manage the overall structure of the internet-based DNS resolutions, and millions of other DNS servers that resolve names for their respective domains

Steps
- Client checks if it is the one
- Client checks local cache
- Client checks `host`/`Imhost` file
- Client queries the DNS
- DNS checks it's cache
- DNS checks it's zones
- DNS checks it's forwarders
- DNS starts at root

## Queries
**Recursive**
- Client sends query to DNS server and expects an IP address for the requested resource as an answer

**Iterative**
- DNS server typically performs an iterative query
- Refers to a requester to the authoritative DNS server for the specific resource rather than providing a full answer

Notes
- Root servers will never accept a recursive query
- Clients will never do an iterative query themselves, would always get a DNS server to do it

## Zones
- specific portion of DNS namespace
- Contains Records
- Can be stored in a file or AD DS
- Types are *Forward Lookup* and *Reverse Lookup*
- Records in forward lookup zones contain - A, AAAA, MX, SRV, NS, SOA, CNAME
- Records in reverse lookup zones contain - SOA, NS, PTR
- Forwards lookup zones always start with two files
	- Start of Authority - points to who is the primary server and other settings such as refresh interval
	- Name Server - Shows where a secondary server is

### Types
**Primary**
- First one you create
- Has full read/write

**Secondary**
- read only
- If something needs to be changed, change it on the primary
- copy of primary
- Needs to reference a primary

**Stub Zone**
- Contains information about a specific zone's authoritative DNS server and is considered special
- Unlike forward and reverse lookup zones, they don't have any resource records except SOA and NS records

**Active Directory**
- If you enable this option, all Domain controllers with a DNS have read/write capabilities even if they are only a secondary

## Troubleshooting DNS
- Most common problems are missing records, incomplete records, incorrectly configured records
- Tools include `NSlookup`, `DNSCmd`, `DNSlint`, `ipconfig`
- Mostly, **flush the cache** and try to ping something using an IP
	- if the ping works, you know it's a name resolution problem

## Replication
- Traditional Primary/Secondary Setup the zone transfer only goes one way (primary -> Secondary) because secondary is read only
- Replication - both are read/write, uses AD
- Zone transfers are always "pulled" by the secondary, never "pushed" by the primary
	- Triggered when: Zone is created, refresh interval expires, DNS service started on secondary server, master server notifies secondary server changes have been made
- If you're using zone files only one server can have the files, the other one has copies and has to request to update files on the primary one

### Types of Zone Transfers
- Full - Entire zone is copied, only really done when the secondary is first created
- Incremental - only get the changes
- Fast - not common, does compression
