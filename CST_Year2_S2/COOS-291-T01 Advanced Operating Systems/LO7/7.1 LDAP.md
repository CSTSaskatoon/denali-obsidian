# Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
- share user account information across Linux network
- Can be used in any program that needs user account information (Ex. authentication, corporate directory, NFS)
- There are other mechanisms to share user account information (Copy `passwd` and `shadow` files to every computer, or Network Information Services (NIS) which basically does the same thing as LDAP)

## Directory Information Tree (DIT)
- Stores information in a hierarchical structure
- starts at the top level with **domain components (dc)**(Ex. `dc=saskpolytech`, `dc=ca`)
- Within the top level an admin has flexibility depending on size and layout of their network (Ex. and organization container `O=SchoolOfInformationAndCommunicationTechnology`)
- Within the domain components or organization container there are **Organizational Units (OU)**
- Based off the same standard - **`X.500`** as used in AD DS though LDAP is more flexible
- **Common name (CN)** used for lowest level (object isn't a container)
- Directory is like a database that you can add, remove and retrieve information from it but unlike a relational database it's hierarchical

### Containers
- Organization is **optional**, but must be used just below the domain components
- Can't have an organization in an organization
- **Organizational Units (OU)** are next level down (below domain components and Organizations), can nest them
- Inside OUs you can have objects like `person`, `poxisAccount`, `inetOrgPerson`, `groups`, etc.
- LDAP **schemas** are a set of rules

### Key Concepts and Terms
- Directory is a tree of data **entries** that is hierarchical in nature
- Entry consists of a set of **attributes**
- Attribute has a **key** (name/description) and one or more **values**
- Attributes and `objectClasses` are defined in **schemas** (`objectClass` is a special kind of attribute)
- Each entry has a unique identifier, **Distinguished Name (DN)**, which has a **Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)** followed by the parent entry's DN
- Entry's DN is NOT an attribute. **It's not considered part of the entity itself**.

### LDAP Server
- Client/server model
- Server provides clients with user account info (`username`, `uid`, `gid`, `passwords`, `home dir`, etc.) - all you need to do is create a user once
- We are going to use **`OpenLDAP`**

#### Setup
- documentation - https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/openldap/
- Your system config might create scenarios that diverge from recipes listed in the docs - might have to modify them
- Also a good chance in a sysadmin job you won't be working on the same distro you learned on

#### Creating a Base
- Base is the top level of `ldap` hierarchy, start at top level and go down
- our initial installation already has a top level we can build on
- get `base.ldif` from brightspace
	- To add content to our database the files need to be in `.ldif`
	- file lists objects starting with distinguished name

### LDAP and Transport Layer Security (TLS)
- We will be creating our own Certificate Authority
- need to install some packages for the **`certtool`** utility - `install gnutls-bin add ssl-cert`

## VM
- Copy `.ldif` files from brightspace
- Copy `templates.ldif` into `~/ldifs` on your client VM
- Copy `templates.ldif` to `george.ldif` and fill in the values for a new user (only need the third template)
- Use `ldapadd -x -W -D "cn=admin,dc=fuckhead,dc=io" -f george.ldif -H ldap://server`
- Enter your password
- On your server, do `sudo slapcat` to make sure the user was added
- On your client, do `ldappasswd -S -D "cn=admin,dc=fuckhead,dc=io" -W -x -H ldap://server "uid=george,ou=users,dc=fuckhead,dc=io"` to set the password of the user
- copy `templates.ldif` to `jetsons.ldif` and fill in the values for a new group (only need the second template)
- do `ldapadd -x -W -D "cn=admin,dc=fuckhead,dc=io" -f jetsons.ldif -H ldap://server`
- do `sudo slapcat` on your server to make sure it worked

## Certificates and SSL With LDAP
 - Missed some stuff in the recording so here is what we did for the first part

```bash
sudo chown :openldap *pem
sudo chmod 640 *.pem
cd ~/ldifs
sudo ldapsearch -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -b "cn=config"
sudo vi addcacertificate.ldif
sudo ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f "addcacertificate.ldif"
sudo ldapsearch -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -b "cn=config" "(cn=config)"
sudo vi addldapems.ldif sudo ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f addldapems.ldif
sudo ldapsearch -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -b "cn=config" "(cn=config)"
```

### `~/ldifs/addcacertificate.ldif`
```ldif
dn: cn=config
add: olcTLSCACertificateFile
olcTLSCACertificateFile: /etc/ssl/certs/myCA.pem
```

### `~/ldifs/addldappems.ldif`
```ldif
dn: cn=config
add: olcTLSCertificateFile
olcTLSCertificateFile: /etc/ldap/karbnldap.server.slapd.cert.pem
-
add: olcTLSCertificateKeyFile
olcTLSCertificateKeyFile: /etc/ldap/karbnldap.server.slapd.key.pem
```
