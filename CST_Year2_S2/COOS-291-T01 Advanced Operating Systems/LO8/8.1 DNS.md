# Domain Name Server (DNS)
## Terminology
### Root Servers
- 13 root servers globally
- Designated letters A to M and managed by various organizations
- More than 13 physical root servers

### Top Level Domain (TLD) Servers
- Store Authoritative information for domains within it's TLD (Ex. `.com`, `.org`, `.net`)
- Keep track of which authoritative name servers are responsible for second level domains (Ex. `example.com`, `example.org`)

### Authoritative Name Servers
- A DNS server that holds the definitive, up-to-date DNS records for a specific domain
- Final source of truth for translating a domain and it's corresponding IP or vice versa

## Resolution Process
- Starts by querying the root server to find the right top level domain server
- Top level domain server will tell you the authoritative name server to go to
- authoritative name server gives you the IP of the server you are trying to reach

## Record Types
- A Record (Address Record)
- AAAA Record (IPv6 Address Record)
- CNAME Record (Canonical Name)
- MX Record (Mail Exchange)
- NS Record (Name Server)
- PTR Record (Pointer Record)
- SOA Record (Start of Authority)

## Finding Other Machines
- `/etc/hosts`
- `/etc/nsswitch.conf`

### Multicast DNS
- For machines identified as being on the `.local` domain, this lets us look up other machines using a multicast request on the LAN
- Situation is as follows
	- Host A sends query for IP of Host Z
	- All `mDNS` hosts see the query
	- host Z responds with it's IP

## Types of DNS Servers
- **Authoritative** - give a definitive answer to a question about a name and it's zone
- **Caching** - Don't have any zones of their own, just store information they have gotten elsewhere
- **Forwarding** - Sends all requests onto other name servers, often set up a network so all outside requests go through one machine
- **Recursive** - recursively query authoritative DNS Servers
- In practice, many name servers do many of these

## Berkley Internet Name Daemon (BIND)
- **`named`**/**`bind9`** - main daemon that handles queries, name resolution and maintains the database - `named -v` shows the current version
- **Configuration files** - `BIND` relies on configuration files (Ex. `/etc/named.conf`) that define how the server operates, zones and the DNS records it handles
- **Zone Files** - files that define the actual DNS records (Ex. `A`, `AAAA`, `NS`, `MX`, etc.) for a domain
- **Install Services** - `sudo apt install bind9 bind9utils bind9-doc dnsutils`

### Config Files in `/etc/bind`
- `/etc/bind/named.conf` - primary config file for **`BIND9`**, contains global settings
- `/etc/bind/named.conf.options` - global options that affect the entire server such as *forwarders*, *DNSSEC* and *query settings*
- `/etc/bind/named.conf.default-zones` - defines default zones, typically used for localhost lookups and reverse lookups
- `/etc/bind/named.conf.local` - define local zones specific to the server, includes zones for authoritative DNS records, and reverse zones
- `/usr/share/dns/root.hints` - list of root DNS servers

### Setting up a forward zone
- When you have a name and you want to get the IP address for it
- Can copy the `db.empty` to a subdirectory called `zones` to a file to get a starting point
- zone entry needs to be added for the file in `/etc/bind/named.conf.local`
- Start of Authority (**SOA**) is the first record and contains info about the zone, required in forward and reverse zones, defines authoritative DNS server for the domain

#### Example Forward Zone SOA
```conf
@   IN SOA <primary DNS server> <responsible person email> (
       <serial number>   (this needs to be incremented each time file is changed)
       <refresh interval>
       <retry interval>
       <expire time>
       <minimum TTL>
)
ns  NS  A  <IP_OF_THIS_SERVER>
;
```

#### SOA Settings
- Serial # for the file - Should update every time you change the file
- Refresh after this period of time - secondary servers will query primary, if Serial #'s don't match it will grab the primary's current records
- Retry - If secondary doesn't get a reply from primary, it will wait this long
- Expire - Secondary server will stop serving requests if primary has been out for this long
- **Don't really touch anything except for serial number**

#### Records in a Forward Zone File
```conf
@  IN  NS  ns.coos291.edu.    (this will map the name to IP from SOA section)
ns  IN  A  10.36.106.YOURSERVER###   (for example 10.36.106.101)
www  IN  A  10.36.106.YOURCLIENT###
```
