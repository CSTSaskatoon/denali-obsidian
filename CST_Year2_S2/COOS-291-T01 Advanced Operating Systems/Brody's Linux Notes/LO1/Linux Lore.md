## History and Philosophy

From 1969 Unix for PDP-7 microcomputer written in assembly for text processing. Naming conventions are based on jokes, like Unix being named from Multics.

1972 Unix was re-written in C, that was made to run Unix.

- Assemble was used to run OS fast
- High level languages like C are "portable"
- C was made to run fast too
- Multiple versions of Unix were made to run on many machines
### Unix Philosophy

Set of culture norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development.

Four Key principles:

- One program does *one thing* well, avoid adding features just make more programs
- Expect the *output* of every program to become to input to another program (typically text). Do not insist on interactive input
- Fast *iterations* of programs
- Made and use *tools* to automate work

Pipe commands and programs together to complete tasks.
### GNU (Gnu's Not Unix) (News)

Emacs is a text and script editor. Version of Unix free of licenses, uses General Public License (GPL). When you make code, make that code available for other people to use (beginning of open source). This project created many libraries but never finished their kernel OS.
### Minix

Minix (mini-Unix). An open source OS, but it was under an educational license. This was made to demonstrate how to made an operating system.
### Linux

Linus Torvalds made his own kernel with tools from Gnu Project and made Linux.
People contribute to this kernel.

## Difference between Kernel and Distros

Kernel is the basic part of the OS - scheduling tasks, talking to devices, etc.
OS is everything - kernel, libraries, utilities, etc.

People do not typically build their own kernel. Typically use a distribution which includes kernel, utilities, applications, etc. They are managed by a team.

Some Distros:

- Debian (volunteer driven, slow and behind to changes for security reasons)
- Linux Mint (based on Debian)
- Ubuntu (based on Debian, sponsored by Canonical, release every 6 months)
- Fedora (Sponsored by Red Hat)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linus (Paid version of Fedora)
- CentOS (free version of RHEL)
- SUSE Linus (from SUSE)
- Open SUSE (free version based on SUSE)
