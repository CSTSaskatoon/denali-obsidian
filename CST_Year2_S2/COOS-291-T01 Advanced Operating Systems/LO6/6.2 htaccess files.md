# `.htaccess files`
- allows a user without root access to change behavior of a directory (and subdirectories) if **`AllowOverride`** allows it
- Modifying them doesn't require a restart
- `AllowOverride` specifies what directories can be modified by these files
	- `All` - all directives that all can be overridden by a `.htaccess` file
	- `None` - disables `.htaccess` files entirely
	- `directive-type` - limits the types of directives that can be overridden
