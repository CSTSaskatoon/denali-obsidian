# Web Servers
- **Apache** has been one of the most popular, configuration is straightforward
- Many web servers have similar settings and the overall concepts carry over

## How Web servers work
![](Pasted%20image%2020250303080518.png)

## Installing Apache
- `sudo apt install apache2`
- **`apachectl`** is used to administrate the **Apache daemon**
- `systemctl` can be used as well but it does other stuff we don't need

## Where things are located
### Server Root
- `/etc/apache2`
	- `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` - Main config file, [backup](Config%20Files/Apache2.conf)
	- `/etc/apache2/ports.conf` - Ports which apache listens on
	- `/etc/apache2/envars` - Apache environment variables
	- `/etc/apache2/mods-enabled` - Modules running on the system
	- `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled` and `/etc/apache2/sites-available` - virtual hosts configurations
- HTML pages located at `/var/www/html`, change change this in directory directive in `/var/www`

### Directories in `apache2.conf`
#### Options
- Controls which features are available in a directory
- `Indexes` allows the server to display directory listings
- `FollowSymLinks` allows the server to follow symbolic links on the server file system

#### `AllowOverride None`
- basically states security in subdirectories can't have their own security settings using `.htaccess`

#### Require
- required to grant access to a resource under certain conditions
- Usually see `Require all denied` or `Require all granted`

### User Directories
- Enable with `sudo a2enmod userdir`
- Can then go to `localhost/~student`, but will get Forbidden because we don't have the right config yet, need to change permissions of `~student/public_html` to 755 and add `www-data` to the `student` group with `sudo usermod www-data -aG student`
- Configuration file is `/etc/apache2/mods-available/userdir.conf`

### Scripts
- Enable module with `sudo a2enmod cgi`
- Ex Script in `/usr/lib/cgi-bin/time.cgi`

### Virtual Hosts
- Let you host multiple websites on the same server
- Can even do different domains for each
- config files located in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/*.conf`
- Create a new config and enable it with `sudo a2ensite fuckface.conf`
- use `apachectl -S` to list all enabled sites and their IP/host names

#### [Example Configuration](Config%20Files/fuckface.conf)

#### Name based and IP Based Virtual Hosts
- Name based are defined using `ServerName` or `ServerAlias` directives and rely on Host header to select the virtual hosts
- If there are multiple name-based virtual hosts on the same IP, Apache looks at the host header sent by the client in the  HTTP request to determine which one to use (Will take the first match)
- IP-Based are defined using the Virtual host directive with an IP address (Ex. `<VirtualHost 192.168.1.1:80>`)

#### Matching Order
1. Look for all exact IP matches
2. Only if there is no exact match, go by wildcards
3. If there are still multiple matches, and the request contains a `Host:` header; look for first matching `ServerName` or `ServerAlias`
4. Otherwise, take first match (last resort)
