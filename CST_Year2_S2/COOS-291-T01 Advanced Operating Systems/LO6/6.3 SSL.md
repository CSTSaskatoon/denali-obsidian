# SSL with Apache2
- `sudo a2enmod ssl` to enable the `ssl` module
## Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Encryption
Symmetrical uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt, fairly simple
Asymmetrical uses public/private key set, message can only be decrypted with private key
Symmetrical is better for traffic because it's simpler and faster but need asymmetrical to set up the connection

## Certificate Authorities
- recognized company to ensure you are who you say you are
- Depending on the level of security required, the company will issue certificates to clients that are uniquely signed with the private key of the Certificate Authority
- Standard web browsers come up with a list of trusted CAs and their public keys which are used to decrypt the certificates
- Certificates are kinda backwards cause encrypted using private key and decrypted using public key

## Self-Signed Certificates
- Browser will complain about it but lets you continue anyways
- Keys (private component) stored in `/etc/ssl/private/*.key`
- Certificates (public component) stored in `/etc/ssl/certs/*.crt`
- Run the command to generate keys `sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt`
- Need to specify these files in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/defualt-ssl.conf` so that it uses the cert and add your hostname as the `ServerName`
- Don't forget to also enable the site - `sudo a2ensite defualt-ssl`

### Options
- `-req` - server signing request using `x509` protocol
- `-nodes`
