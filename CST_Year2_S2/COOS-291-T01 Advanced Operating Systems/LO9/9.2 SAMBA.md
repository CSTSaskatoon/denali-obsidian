# SAMBA
- Idea of shares comes from SMB
- SMB has had various versions
- Common Internet Filing System (CIFS) was one variation

## History
- Originally MS wasn't interested in networking
- **Novel** did a lot of early networking for MS products
- MS expanded their efforts when they realized they could make money off it
- Unix/Linux side established NFS for file sharing
- DEC provided a networking product called NFS for PCs which could be used by clients to access backend unix/linux servers

## Andrew Tridgell
- Was working on NFS for PCs and started looking at Unix-based systems to "Talk PC" (SMB)
- Created software under GPL that could talk to SMB
- Called SAMBA

## What it can do
- Can act as a file server for Windows based machines
- Allow Linux/Unix systems to access Windows shares

### Can act as
- File Server on Windows Server
- Print Server on Windows network
- Member server in a domain
- Domain Controller in a Windows LAN
- Can join as a member server on Active Directory
- Host a Distributed File System (DFS)

## Configuration
- `sudo apt-get install samba`
- `/etc/samba`
- `smb.conf` contains a series of share specifications
- Shares start with `[sharename]`

#### Example
```conf
[stuff]
path = /stuff
comment = A place for stuff
volume = stuff-drive
writable = yes
guest ok = no
```

### Properties
- `path`
- `browseable` - Whether clients can browse the directory
- `writeable`
- `guest` - Often Windows guest connections are blocked

### Testing the config
- `testparm`

### Starting the Service
- `smb`/`smbd` - both aliases to `smbd.service`
- `nmb`/`nmbd` - both aliases to `nmbd.service`
