# Filesystem Theory
## Hardware Level
- Hard Disks
- Tracks/cylinders
- Sectors - traditionally 512 bytes for HDD, 2048 for CD-ROM
- Heads

## File System Types in Linux
- **Ext4** - most common
- **XFS** - most common non-ext file system, default for Redhat, more for enterprise than home use
- **BTRFS** - has snapshotting and compression built in, some other advanced features, has copy on-write technique to eliminate file corruption

### System Structure
- All users interact with files the same way regardless of file system types
- Everything starts are root - `/`
- Different devices are **mounted** at different locations in the file system at **mount** points
- Directories are a special type of file which contains a list of other files within it and their `inodes`, which can in turn be directories (making them **subdirectories**)
- Root (`/`) doesn't have a name because no directory contains it to store the name and `inode` for it

## Logical Volume Management
### Structure

### Tools
#### Physical Volume (`pv`)
- `pvcreate`
- `pvdisplay`, `pvs`
- `pvremove`

#### Volume Group (`vg`)
- `vgcreate`
- `vgdisplay`, `vgs`
- `vgextend`
- `vgreduce`

#### Logical Volume (`lv`)
- `lvcreate`
- `lvdisplay`, `lvs`
- `lvremove`
- `lvresize`
