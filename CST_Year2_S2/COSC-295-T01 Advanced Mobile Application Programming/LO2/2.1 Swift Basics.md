## Data Types
### Numbers
`Int` - standard for whole numbers, uses word size of the platform so on 64 bit it would be 64 bits
`Int16`
`int32`
`UInt` - Unsigned
`UInt16`
`UInt32`
`Float` - 32 bit floating
`Double` - 64 bit floating
`Bool` - true/false

When inferring data types, the compiler will always choose `Double` for decimal values and `Int` for whole numbers
Even primitive types are stored as objects with methods and properties

### Characters
`Character`
Store a single character, though can store Unicode characters.
Don't use single quotes
Compiler will never infer a Character, always a String

### Strings
`String`
An array of characters
many common string methods exist in Swift

Common methods
- `count`
- `isEmpty`
- `upperCased`

Can do basic comparisons (`==`, `>`, `>=`, etc.) which are not shallow comparisons
if case doesn't matter, change them both to upper/lowercase obviously

### Compound Types
has no name and is defined in Swift at compile time
- `Tuple`
- `Function`

### Optional Values
a variable can be set to optional meaning it may hold a value or it may be `nil`
Done to force you to deal with the value safely (check for `nil` values)
Avoid runtime crashes
indicated with a `?` at the end of the type (Ex. `var optionalNumber: Int?`)
whenever working with an optional a safe approach is check for `nil` such as an if statement
- Ex. `if opValue != nil { /* Do something */ }`

Alternatively you can use `??` or `!`

#### Force Unwrap Operator
`!`
force the optional to be "unwrapped" (access the value)
If the optional contains a nil it will cause a crash
Should only be used if you are certain (check with an if)
Ex. `print(name!);`

#### Nil Coalesce
`??`
Provides a default to be used if the optional value is `nil`
"substitute value"
Ex. `print(name ?? "Joe Schmoe");`

## Questions Exercise
1. `let letter : Character = 'A'` - can't use single quotes, compile error
2. `var letter = "A"` - considered a string
3. `var letters = "AA"` - considered a string
4. `var letter : Character; print(letter)` - uninitialized variable, compile error
5. `var ðŸ¤  = "Cowboy"` - valid, string
6. `var "cowboy" = ðŸ¤ ` - invalid, syntax error
7. `print("Result is " + (1 + 2))` - can't add a number to a string, compile error `print("Result is \(1 + 2)")`
8. `print(myVar!)` - either works, or a runtime error because value was `nil`
9. How does `??` relate to `nil`? - Provides a default value if the value is `nil`

## Converting Between Types
Many types have conversion functions available

The built-in ones take the form of `TypeName(otherTypeValue)`
Ex. `Int("5")` returns an *optional `Int?`* that will contain `nil` if the conversion fails

In general when performing conversions it's good practice to check for `nil`

## Input from the Keyboard
This takes input from standard input (usually the keyboard), called `stdin`
Supported well in some environments (interactive)  and in others it isn't interactive
`readLine()` returns an optional `String?` that you have to unwrap
Unwrapping this with `!` should always be safe because it will wait for input. 
Using `??` is probably safer but it seems unnecessary
`var input = readLine()!` - input is no longer optional
