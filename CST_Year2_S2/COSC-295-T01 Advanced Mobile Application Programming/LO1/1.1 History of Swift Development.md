# Background and History of Swift Development
Swift is a general purpose programming language intended to replace C, C++ and Objective C. 
Previously, Objective C was required to develop macOS and iOS apps

The goal of the swift language is to create best available for system programming, mobile and desktop apps

## Safe, Fast, Expressive
### Safe
Swift is designed to be safer than the C based languages
Eliminates/rewrites classes of code, **variables must be initialized** before use, arrays and integers are **checked for overflow**
**Memory is managed** automatically, **objects can never be nil** (null) - trying to make use of a nil object will be a compile error rather than a runtime crash

### Fast
Swift is 2.6 times faster than Object C and up to 8 times faster than Python

### Expressive
combines features from Objective C, Object Oriented languages like Java and Python and functional programming languages like Lisp and Scala
Code is self-documenting in some ways

## History
First version released in 2014
2.0 released in 2015
3.0 released in 2016
4.0 released in 2017, made a lot of larger changes
5.0 released in 2019 and had a lot of maintenance releases
6.0 released in 2024

## Compare Objective C and Swift
Provides seamless compatibility with Objective C
Can use Swift APIs in Objective C and vise versa
Mixed language apps are typical

### Reasons why Swift is better
#### Easier to Read
To call a method in Objective C - `output = [object methodName:input];`
To call a method in Swift - `output = methodName(input)`

#### Safer
Objective C handles pointers strangely - a null pointer causes the program to ignore that line and move on
Swift uses optional types forcing you to deal with the possibility of a nil at compile time
Swift requires less code as Objective C can be very verbose

## Swift Development and Projects
You can create swift code in `.swift` text files which are then compiled and can be run
Any number of classes and functions can be in one of these files, but it's good practice to separate classes into their own files
There should be a file called `main.swift` which is the starting point of the program

### IDEs
Xcode is good but can only be used on macOS
other environments in Windows, Linux and Online (we will use https://repl.it)
