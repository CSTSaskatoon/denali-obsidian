# Object Oriented
## Functions
use the keyword `func` to declare
In general should be declared before use in the same file

### Syntax
```swift
func funcName(parameterList) -> returnType
{
	 // do stuff
	 return value
}
```

When `parameterList` is a non-compulsory list of parameters and their types are in the form `paramName: paramType`
The return type is also not required if it's void
Calling a function
```
funcName(paramName: paramValue, paramName2: paramValue2, ...);
```
By default the labels must be included in each argument

## Methods
Methods and functions are functionally the same except that methods are inside of objects, functions are outside of objects

## External Parameter Names
Internal names are used within the body of the function
External names are used when calling the function

### Syntax
```swift
func funcName(externalName InternalName: type) -> returnType
```

## Default Values
A function may have default values which makes it so the parameter can be left in the call in which case the default value will be used as the value for the parameter
can have multiple or even all parameters with default values

### Syntax
```swift
func funcName(paramName: paramType = defaultValue) -> returnType;
```

## Variadic Parameters
Allows 0, 1 or more values of the same type passed into the parameter
Internal treated as an array sorted in the same order they were passed in
**Why the fuck would you not just use an array**

### Syntax
```swift
func funcName(variadicParam: paramType...); // ... means variadic

// Calling
funcName(variadicParam: val1, val2, val3, etc.);
// or
funcName();
```
## Parameters as Let Constants
By default all parameters are read only and are pass by value
Must take a copy of them to change the value
Can use `inout` to pass by reference

## `inout`
pass by reference

### Syntax
```swift
inoutParamName: inout paramType

// Calling
funcName(inoutParamName)
```

## Function Type (Delegate in C#)
Unnamed type based on the number and types of parameters and return type.
Variable can store a function type which would be a reference to the function and then the function could be called through the variable

### Syntax
```swift
(Int, Int) -> Int
// or
(Double)() // void
```
Any functions that have the same signature structure and have the same function type

### Example
```swift
var f: (Int) -> Int; // Declaring a variable with a function type
f = someFunction;
print(f(5));
```

## Structs
A collection of member properties and methods that can be instantiated.
Structures and classes are very similar but the key difference is structs are value types and classes are reference types
Basically, **Structures are copied when passed in as parameters to functions**

Properties can be defined as regular properties or as computed properties that return a value

### Initializers (Constructor)
constructors which must make sure all properties receive an initial value
Compile error if it fails
Gets created automatically
Default initializer takes in no values, only usable if all parameters have default values
If an initializer is defined, none will be created automatically
`self` keyword can be used if the parameters are named the same as the properties (like `this` in literally everything else, fuck this language)

#### Syntax
```swift
public init(params) { ... }
```

### Mutating Methods
Instance properties cannot be mutated (changed) within the methods of a struct (except the initializers)
- basically you can't have a setter for a property

Need the `mutating` keyword when declaring the properties to make them mutable (changeable) from outside of the struct if the properties are public
- `public mutating var name: String;`

### Type Properties (Static)
Allow data to be shared between all instances (or without any instances)
Instance properties have one value per instance whereas type properties have one shared value for all instances

### Type Methods (Static)
Called against the struct and not the instance (Ex. `Room.GetName()` vs `myRoom.GetName()`)
Can access only the type properties and not any instance properties

## Classes
Reference types and can use Inheritance
Act like structs in many ways (They are better in every way)

Access modifiers are `public`, `private`, `internal` (`internal` makes the method inheritable, like `protected` in Java)

### Initializers (Constructors)
Initializer must ensure all properties are given values, whether by setting them or if they have default values
Member wise initializer will not be automatically generated, but default initializer will be if all properties have default values

**Designated Initializer** - does the work of setting everything and can't end without all properties having a value
**Convenience Initializer** - will call other initializers marked as `convenience`
- Ex. `public convenience init(params) { self.init(params); ... }`

### Methods
Work the same as in Structs but don't need to use the `mutating` keyword to change properties
Can be overridden in subclasses

### Inheritance
Derive a subclass based on a super class
Sub class will inherit any public properties and methods from super class
Private properties or methods can't be directly accessed through sub class (use `internal` keyword for this)
A class can only inherit from one class, but you can nest them
Methods and computed properties that override methods in the super class need the `override` keyword

#### Syntax
```swift
public SubClass: SuperClass
```

### Polymorphism
- `is A` relationship (`Student Is A Person`)
- Basically you can represent an object as it's parent
- Variables declared as sub classes can be referred to by references of a super class type, or many higher level type in the inheritance hierarchy
- Dynamically at run time it will be determined which version of a method or property to use based on that object that was actually instantiated.

### Initializers in Sub Classes
- You **MUST** call the super initializer somewhere in the sub class
- If no sub class initializers are defined, the super class initializers are called directly and passed the arguments
- If the initializer in the subclass has the same signature as a parent initializer it must be marked with override

### Computed Properties wrapping Private properties
- Basically a way to make a private property public and limiting access to it (ensure it's not an invalid value)
- Often called wrapping

### Protocols (Interfaces)
- Swift doesn't have abstract classes, but it does have protocols which are just interfaces
- A class, struct or protocol can implement any number of protocols.
- Any class or struct that implements a protocol must have implementations of all members of the protocol

#### Syntax
```swift
public protocol ProtocolName
{
    func protocolFunction() // Function
    var propertyName: Type { get; set; } // Computed Property
}

public class ClassName: Protocol1, Protocol2, ...
```

`CustomStringConvertible` is the `toString` protocol in swift
- Single property

#### Creating
- By convention, the suffix used to name protocols in swift is "able" or "ible" (Convertible, Runnable, etc.)
- Use the keyword `protocol` to define one
- Method and Property stubs are placed in the protocol

## Differences between Structs and Classes
- `struct` is a **Value Type** and `class` is a **Reference Type**
- Structs and classes both may get default initializers if all properties are given default initial values, but only struct will receive an auto generated member wise initializer
- Properties of structs are immutable unless otherwise specified
- Classes can use full inheritance, structs are limited to protocols
- For functions, structs can't be modified if they are parameters, though the `inout` keyword can be used to make it pass by reference
- Constant structs behave like constant ints, none of their properties change. (Struct is immutable and properties are immutable)
- Constant classes you can't change the reference to the object but you can change the properties inside it (Class is immutable but properties are mutable)

### Why
- "Structs are simpler and have less functionality" - One truth and one lie in this
- "Easier to use for instance to deal with in a multithreaded program"
- "Less overhead and do a good job packaging simple data" - So do classes?
- "Could be used to represent a piece of data from a database table row" - **SO CAN CLASSES**
- "Classes offer inheritance and their ability and are pass by reference" - (And they are better)
- "Best practice is to use structs unless you need inheritance or pass by reference" - fuck that

## Enumerations
- a collection of items/choices/elements
- Instance variable will be one of the possibilities at any one time
- It's complete (can't add or remove them at runtime?)
- Value type

### Syntax
```swift
// Declaration
enum EnumName
{
	case Value1, Value2, Value3, Value4, ...
}

// Assignment
var x = EnumName.Value1;

// Comparison
if x == Enum.Value2;
```

### Raw Types
- Each enum may be mapped to values of a specific type, called the enum's raw type
- Ex. an enum of the month's year might map `January 1` to `Int 1`
- Should only be used if they are useful (**Obviously**)

#### Syntax
```swift
enum EnumName: RawType
{
	case Element1 = value1;
	case Element2 = value2;
}
```

### Initializer
```swift
init(rawValue: value) // Have to unwrap
```

### Enums with Switch Statements
- default isn't required as long as all cases are covered
- Often used for traversals?

```swift
switch (enumVar)
{
	case .value1:
		// Do something
	case .value2:
		// Do something else
	// etc.
}
```

### Enumeration Methods
- Are these even enumerations anymore or have we just recreated structs
- behave like struct methods
- may also conform to protocols and then must implement all of the method stubs
- Usually methods are meant to traverse through enumerations or provide some common calculation
- Raw value can be accessed with `self.rawValue`
- method must be marked with mutating if it changes the value

## Arrays
- Named Collection types (Explicitly typed)
- Act like vectors (keep getting larger as items are appended), but trying to index oob will cause a run time error
- Value Types (not pass by reference)
- Implements the string convertible thing

### Syntax
```swift
// Short form Declaration 
var arrayName = [Int]();
// Long form Declaration
var arrayName: [Int] = [Int](); // the : [Int] is optional
// Collections syntax
var arrayName = Array<Int>(); // I much prefer this
// Array literal
var arrayName = [ 10, 20, 30 ];
// Short form with initial size
var arrayName = [Int](count: 10) // horrible

// Indexing into (using the array)
arrayName[index];

// foreach
for value in array
{
	// Do something
}

// useful methods and properties
myArray.append(value);
myArray += [value];
myArray.removeAt(index);
myArray.removeLast();
myArray.count;
myArray.shuffle();
```
