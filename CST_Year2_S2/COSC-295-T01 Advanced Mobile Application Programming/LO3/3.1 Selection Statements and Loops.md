## If Statements
Basic `if` statements work like normal with two differences
1. The `()` aren't required
2. The `{}` are required

Nested `if`s are allowed and work as normal
Relational and logical operators are `== != > >= < <= ! && ||`
Two additional operators are called identity operators `===` and `!==` check for identical objects in memory
`==` and `!=` are only used for checking the value's equality

## Switch Statements
`break;` isn't required
cases must be exhaustive - all cases covered or there will be a compile error
In practice, the `default` case is always required to satisfy the compiler
can use ranges such as `0...40` or `0..<40`
Can also use `where` clauses

## Ternary Operator
Works like it does elsewhere
Ex. `let result = num % 2 == 0 ? "Even" : "Odd";`

## Repetition (Looping)
Swift has a `while`, `do while` and other loops

`while` and `do while` don't require `()` but do require `{}`

for loop doesn't have the same structure as the c-style for loop
```swift
for i in 1...10 // or for _ in 1...10 if you don't care about the increment value
{
 print(i);
}
```
