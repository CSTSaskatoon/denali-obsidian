# Persistent Storage
## Serialization (`SecureStorage`)
- Not really serialization
- Acts like Shared Preferences in Android
- lets you save key-value pairs

### Accessing Secure Storage
- Two relevant commands, one for write and one for read
- Calls are **`async`**
- `string result = await SecureStorage.GetAsync("SomeKeyName");`
- `await SecureStorage.SetAsync("SomeKeyName", "SomeValue");`

## SQLite Database Access
- Will be using Object Relation Mapping (ORM) to map database objects
- Database access on both android and iOS is supported through `sqlite-db`

### Install SQLite PCL
- Go to tools -> Nuget Package Manager -> Package Manager Console -> `Install-Package sqlite-net-pcl -Version 1.4.118`
