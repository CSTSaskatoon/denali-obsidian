# Generics
- when generics are used within an instance, the type contained must be specified.
- Will have a placeholder type (Ex. `T` or `E`, but can be any valid name)
- Placeholder is replaced by the appropriate data type when an object is instantiated

## Subscripts
- Index operator (`[]`) is created using the subscript keyword
- Typically takes in a position as an `Int` and returns a matching value
- Often returns an optional because it might not find it
- Can be setup to take in any type and return any type
- Can be added directly to a type

#### Syntax
```swift
subscript (index: TypeName) -> ReturnType // ReturnType is often optional
{
	get { return "fuck" }
	set (newValue) { /* Do Something, often set the value at the index */ }
	// Doesn't have to have both get and set
}
```
