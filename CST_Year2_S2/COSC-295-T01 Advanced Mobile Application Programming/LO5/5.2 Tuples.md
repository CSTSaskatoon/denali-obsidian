# Tuples
- simple way to treat a group of values as a single entity
- Unnamed compound type
- Characterized by the types it contains (Ex. a `(String, Int)` Tuple for a grave)
- Can be nested (Ex. `("Friday", (2, 30))`)

#### Syntax
```swift
var name = (values...)
// Or more strongly typed
var name: (ValueTypes...) = (values...)

// Access Elements using . notation
print("Element 0 is \(name.0)")
```

### Names
- Each position may optionally be given a name
- The position may then be referred to by the position number of the label name
- Ex. `var match: (home: String, homeScore: Int, visitor: String, visitorScore: Int)`

### Arrays
- Tuples can be stored in collections/arrays

### Switches
- Can use a switch on a tuple and each case may compare the position value sin the switch with a "where" clause case
- Ex. `case("value", 5...10): print("fjksdjfldsjf")` or `case(_, 11...20`, where the `_` indicates we don't care about the value in that position of the tuple

### Functions
- Tuples can be used as parameters and return values in functions
- In practice, this allows returning more than one value form a function without using objects or pass by reference
