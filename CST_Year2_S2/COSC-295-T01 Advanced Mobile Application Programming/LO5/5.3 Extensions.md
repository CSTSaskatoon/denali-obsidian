# Extensions
- Adding additional code to a type without subclassing
- New functionality can be added to built in types and custom types regardless of if the original source code is accessible
- Not given a name, simply identify what type they are adding to
- Have access to the `self` keyword

### Can add the following
- Computed Properties
- Methods
- Initializers
- Subscripts (With `[]`)
- Nested types (Type within a type)

#### Syntax
```swift
extension Type
{
	public func funcName() -> ReturnType
	{
		// Do some stuff
	}
}

// Ex.
extension String
{
	public func length() -> Int
	{
		return self.count // This is basically just a .count wrapper for String
	}
}

// Using
let ex = "Fuck"
print(ex.length())
```
