# Operator Overload Functions
Swift allows traditional operators (`==, +, -`, etc.) to be overloaded with our own custom functions.
- Ex. it might be helpful to have a `==` operator for a class we have created

#### Syntax
```swift
func OpSymbol(left: TypeL, right: TypeL) -> ReturnType

// Ex.
func ==(left: MyClass, right: MyClass) -> Bool
```
Compiler will look for a matching operator and class that function
If the function is placed as a method in a class, it must be marked as `static`
