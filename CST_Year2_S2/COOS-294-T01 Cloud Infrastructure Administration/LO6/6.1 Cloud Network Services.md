# Cloud Network Services
## On-Prem Network Design
- Routers facing ISP
- Perimeter network and internal zone have private IPs
	- Perimeter is usually somewhat accessible from the internet
	- Internal Aren't accessible on the internet
	- Admin has full control over IP address assignment, name resolution, security settings and rules
- Admin can add or remove on-prem subnets to accommodate network devices and services

### Layers
- Internet/ISP
- PIP (Perimeter)
- Core
- Distribution
- Access
- Clients
- *Core - Access Seem like they are just kinda internal routers/switches so I think you can just go from Client -> PIP in a really small network*

## Azure IP Addressing
- Azure virtual networks use private IPs
- Range of IPs are the same as for on-prem
- Admins have full control over assignment, name resolution, etc.
- Admin can add or remove subnets on the CIDR for IP address block

### Network Design Components in Azure
- Virtual Networks
- Subnets
- Network Security Groups
- Firewalls
- Load Balancers

### Network Design
- Functions similar to on-prem but structure is different
- Is **Not Hierarchical**
- Scale up and down infrastructure
- No hardware, everything is *virtual*
- Typically implement a *network security group* and *firewall*
- Use *subnets* to isolate
- Network security groups filter traffic
- Firewall has more filtering capabilities
- Improved isolation and security if you implement firewalls and security groups

#### Structure
![](Pasted%20image%2020250304092729.png)

### Public and Private Addresses
- Need public address for communication with the internet and public facing services
- Private addresses used in the *Azure Virtual Network* (VNet) and on-prem network if you use a *VPN gateway*/*ExpressRoute* circuit to extend your network infrastructure to Azure

### Properties of Azure Virtual Networks
- Network in the cloud
- Can do multiple subnets
- Can add/remove/shrink subnets as you like
- By default, all subnets in a Azure Virtual Network can communicate with each other
- Can use a network security group to deny communication between subnets
- Smallest subnet supported is *`/29`* (8 total hosts, but lose 5 in Azure)
- Largest subnet is *`/2`*

### Integrate Azure with On-Prem networks
- Identify current private IP scheme used in prem network
- No overlapping IPs (use different subnets)
- Can have the same class range for multiple networks

## IP Address Types
- Dynamic, Static
- Public, Private

### Public IPs
- Needed for public-facing services
- Can be static or dynamic
- Can be assigned to: VM, Internet facing load balancer, VPN gateway, Application gateway
- Dynamic public IPs assigned to resources can change over their lifespan
- Default allocation method is dynamic
- Static IPs assigned to resources that don't change over their lifespan, only deleted when you delete the resource or change it to dynamic
- Public IP is an object in Azure

### SKUs for public IPs
#### Basic
- Can assign either static or dynamic
- can assign them to any Azure Resource that can be assigned a public IP
- By default: Are **open**, **available for inbound only traffic**, **don't support availability zones**, **don't support any routing preferences**

### Private IPs
- used for communication in an Azure Virtual Network, including virtual networks on-prem
- Can set to dynamic or static
- Static private IPs persist if you stop/deallocate the resource

### Azure Virtual Networks
- Admin has full control
- Private addressing works the same as on-prem
- Use CIDR notation for everything - **Bigger Number = Fewer addresses**
- First 3 addresses are reserved by default
- First and last IPs of all subnets are also reserved
	- `.0` - defines the network
	- `.1` - routing (default gateway)
	- `.2` - DNS
	- `.3` - another DNS
	- `.255` (or last IP in the subnet) - broadcast address

#### Characteristics
- logical isolation
- Provision and manage VPNs
- Some other shit

#### Public IP SKUs
Basic
- Static or dynamic
- Open by default
- Any resource can use
- not zone redundant

Standard
- Static
- Secure by default, closed to inbound traffic
- Only usable by network interfaces and standard load balancers
- zone redundant by default

## Network Security Groups
- Limit network traffic
- Similar to a basic **firewall**, filter based on IPs and port
- List of rules to allow/deny traffic
- Needs to be associated with a **subnet** or **network interface**
- Can be associated multiple times (put it on multiple interfaces)
- Can create a **DMZ** by associating a subnet with a security group

### Characteristics
- Azure creates default rules (Ex. `DenyAllInbound` and `AllowInternetOutbound`)
- Can add more rules with by changing the settings - `Name`, `Priority`, `Port`, `Protocol`, `Source`, `Destination`, `Action`
- Priority is backwards, **highest priority number will go last**

### Inbound Traffic Rules
- Three are defined by default - `AllowVnetInBound`, `AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound`, `DenyAllInBound`
	- Since `DenyAllInBound` is the highest priority number (will happen last), it only denies the traffic if it doesn't meet the other two rules

### Outbound Traffic Rules
- Three defined by default - `AllowVnetOutBound`, `AllowInternetOutBound`, `DenyAllOutBound`

## Peering
- A way to connect VNETs
- Can use it even if the virtual networks are in different subscriptions
- Needs two virtual networks
- needs at least one VM
- Can configure VPN Gateway in the peered network as a transit point
- Uses remote VPN Gateway to get access to other resources

### Transitivity
- Peering is non-transitive
- Only virtual networks that are directly peered can communicate with each other (No "friends of friends" type system)

### Gateway transit
- Can connect to on-prem network via a peered virtual network

### Extending
- Methods are Hub and Spoke networks, user-defined routes and service chaining

### Alternatives
- Peering is the least complex
- Other methods focus mostly on connecting on-prem to azure
- ExpressRoute - dedicated between on-premises and azure

## DNS
- Hosting and managing domains using globally distributed namespaces
- Allows you to create private zones
- provides name resolution for VMs with and between Virtual networks
- Hostnames are automatically maintained
- Supports split-horizon DNS

## Azure Load Balancer
- Some apps have so much incoming traffic that the single server hosting them becomes overwhelmed and can't respond to clients in time
- Instead of vertically scaling you can horizontally scale and use a load balancer.
- Load balancing is a process in which you *distribute traffic equitably across multiple computers*
- Provides **high availability** and better network traffic because it changes how traffic is distributed, and "health probes" ensure the resources are healthy and traffic is being directly correctly

### Types
- **Public** - internet traffic going to your VMs, maps public IP and port number of incoming traffic to the private IP and port number of the backend pool of VMs
- **Internal** - directs traffic to resources that are inside a virtual network or that use a VPN to access Azure Infrastructure, never directly exposed to an internet endpoint, Internal line-of-business apps that run in azure

### How it works
- Works at **Layer 4** of the OSI model (IP addresses and port numbers)
- Elements that work together to ensure high availability
	- Front-end IP
	- Load balancer Rules
	- Back-end pool
	- Health probes
	- Inbound NAT rules
	- High availability rules
	- Outbound rules

### Front-end IP
- address clients use to connect to your web app
- Can be public or private
- Can have multiple for one Load balancer
- Selection determines type of load balancer (Public IP = Public load balancer, Private IP = Internal Load balancer)

### Rules
- Load balancer rules defines how traffic is distributed
- maps a given frontend IP and port combination to a set of backend IP/Port combinations
- Can configure different rules for each frontend IP
- Can't apply different rules based on internal traffic content because it operates at layer 4 (transport layer) of the OSI model
- If you need to manage traffic based on layer 7 properties use Azure Application Gateway
- 5-tuple hash made from following elements
	- Source IP
	- Source Port
	- Destination IP
	- Destination Port
	- Something else

### Backend pool
- Group of VMs in a Virtual Machine Scale Set that responds to incoming requests
- Autoconfiguration to redistribute load across altered number of instances when you scale instances up or down

### Health Probes
- Used to determine the health status of VMs in the backend pool
- Determines if an instance is healthy and good to receive traffic
- Can define unhealthy thresholds
- Types are *TCP*, *HTTP* or *HTTPS*

### Session Persistence
- Not enabled by default
- connections from the same client go to the same backend instance when possible

### Inbound and Outbound NAT Rules
- Use NAT rules in combination with the load balancer (doesn't need to be the internet)

## Application Gateway
- Form of load balancing, operates at **Layer 7**
- More expensive than the load balancer, so only use it if you need the layer 7 stuff
- Support for TLS/SSL encryption
- Uses Round Robin
- "Session stickiness" = Session affinity

### How it works
- Frontend IP (can be public/private/both), can't have more than one public and one private
- Listeners - uses one or more listeners to receive incoming requests
- Routing Rules - binds a listener to a backend pol, specifies how to interpret the hostname and path elements in the URL

### Load Balancing
- Works at layer 7
- Uses Round Robin

### Web Application Firewall
- Not required
- Checks for "common threats"

### Backend pools
- Can be Virtual machines, Scale set, Azure App Services
- Each pool has an associated load balancer
- All servers should be configured the same
- Gateway encrypts traffic, if using App service you don't need any extra certs
- Gateway uses a rule to determine how to distribute the traffic

### Path Based Routing
- Sends requests with different URL paths to different pools

### Multiple Site Routing
- Will look at different URLs (Ex. If you're hosting 2 web apps)
- Separate listeners for each site
- Gateway also has Redirection, Rewrite HTTP headers and Custom Error pages

### TLS/SSL Termination
- Offloads the workload from your servers
- Don't need to install certs
- Don't need to install TLS/SSL on your servers

### Health Probes
- Server can return status from 200 to 399 to be considered healthy
- If you don't make one, Gateway will make a default one that waits for 30s

## Routes
- Network traffic in Azure is automatically routed across subnets, VNets and On-prem networks
- Controlled by **system routes**
- Using system routes, any Azure VM that gets deployed into a VNET can communication with any other in the network
- Can't create or delete system routes, can override them by adding **custom routes** to control next hop
- Azure will create other system routes if you enable VNET Peering, Service chaining, Virtual network gateway, or Virtual network service endpoint

### Next hop type
- **Virtual Network** - route created in address prefix, represents each address range created at VNET level
- if multiple address ranges are specified multiple routes are created for each range
- **Internet** - default system route `0.0.0.0/0`, routes any address range to the internet unless you override it
- **None** - any traffic routed here is dropped and doesn't get routed outside the network

### Traffic flow through system routes
![](Pasted%20image%2020250313084702.png)

### Peering and Service Chaining
- Creates more entries in the routing table
- lets virtual networks communicate with each other
- service chaining lets you override theses routes by creating user-defined routes between peered networks

### Virtual Network Gateway
- send encryption between Azure and on-prem via the internet
- Contains routing tables and gateway services

### Virtual Network Service Endpoint
- extends private address space in Azure by providing direct connection to resources
- Restricts flow of traffic
- Azure creates routes in route table to direct traffic

### Custom Routes
- System routes make it easy to set up environments but sometimes it's not done the way you want
- Ex. if you want traffic to go through a firewall
- Two options - user defined routes or border gateway protocol

#### User Defined Routes
- override system defaults so traffic can be routed through firewalls or NVAs
- Ex. network with two subnets and want add a virtual machine to perimeter network to be used as a firewall
- Can specify these next hop types  - Virtual appliance, Virtual Network Gateway, Virtual Network, Internet, None

### Route Selection and Priority
- if multiple routes are available, Azure uses the "longest prefix match"
- Can't configure multiple user defined routes with the same address prefix

### Service Tags for defined routes
- instead of an IP range
- represents a group of IPs
- MS manages address prefixes encompassed by the service tags and automatically update the tags
- Minimizes complexity of frequent updates to user-defined routes, reduces the number of routes you need to create

### Border Gateway protocol
- specific to routers

## Network Virtual Appliance (NVA)
- virtual appliance that consists of layers like firewall, WAN optimizer, Application delivery controllers, routers, load balancers, IDS/IPS, proxies
- Can deploy NVAs to providers in Azure marketplace (Ex. Cisco, Check Point, Barracuda, Sophos, WatchGuard, SonicWall)
- filter traffic inbound to virtual network, block malicious requests and block requests made from unexpected resources
- Virtual machine that controls the flow of your network traffic
- usually placed in the perimeter network
- All traffic is routed through the firewall and inspected by NVA
- acts as a router that forwards requests between subnets
- Some require multiple network interfaces
