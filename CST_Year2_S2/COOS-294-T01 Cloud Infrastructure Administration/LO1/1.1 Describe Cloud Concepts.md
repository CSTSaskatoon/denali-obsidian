# Describe Cloud Concepts
## Cloud Computing
Delivery of computing services over the internet
Common IT Infrastructure like VMs, storage, databases and networking
Can include additional things like
- IoT
- Machine Learning
- Artificial Intelligence

Not constrained by physical infrastructure
If you need to increase IT infrastructure rapidly don't have to wait to build a new datacenter, you can just use the cloud

## Shared Responsibility Model
In a traditional corporate datacenter
- Company is responsible for maintaining physical space, security, maintaining servers
- IT Department is responsible for software

Cloud
- Physical stuff is the responsibility of the cloud provider
- Consumer is responsible for data on the servers and access security

Heavily tied with cloud service types
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS)
- IaaS places most responsibility on the consumer
- SaaS places most responsibility on the Cloud Provider
- PaaS is in the middle

## Cloud Models
**Public**
- Apps can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned
- Organizations only pay for what they use
- Organizations don't have complete control over resources and security
- Public Cloud is based on what resources you use (Run as you go model)
- Can allocate more or less resources based on demand

**Private**
- What SaskPolytech used to be
- Organizations have complete control over resources and security
- Data is not collocated with other organizations data
- Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance (organization)
- Organizations responsible for hardware maintenance and updates
- Private Cloud is based on hours most of the time

**Hybrid**
- Most flexibility
- Organizations determine where to run their apps
- Organizations control security, compliance, legal requirements

### Multicloud
New term
Using multiple cloud services (Some services in Azure, some in AWS, etc.)
Reduced risk of downtime
- If one provider has an outage, switch to another provider

Cost optimization
Improved Security
- Reduces risk of Single Point of Failure
- Different providers for different security needs

Flexibility
Better Performance
- Right provider for the right workload

### Public Cloud Providers
Microsoft Azure
- Fastest growing
- Exclusive offering of MS products

Amazon (AWS)
- Biggest, most adopted

Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Oracle Cloud
Alibaba Cloud

## Consumption Based Model
With IT infrastructure models, there are two expenses to consider
- Capital Expenditure (CapEx) - One time, expensive (Ex. buying a building)
- Operational Expenditure (OpEx) - continuing to do over time, often monthly (Ex. renting)

Cloud services are Operational Expenditure because you pay for it as you use it

## Benefits of Cloud Services
High Availability
- Guarantees are part of the Service-level agreements (SLAs)
- Focuses on max availability regardless of disruptions

Scalability
- Adjust resources to meet demand
- Very quick
- don't overpay for services, reduce resources if demand drops off
- *Vertical* scaling - increasing/decreasing instance resources (more ram/CPU cores, etc.)
- *Horizontal* scaling - adding/subtracting number of instances 

Reliability
- Ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
- the cloud naturally supports a reliable and resilient infrastructure
- Decentralized design

Predictability
- Performance predictability focuses on resources needed to effectively deliver services
- Load balancing, auto scaling, high availability
- Cost predictability focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend
- Track resources in real time, monitor resources, data analytics
- Can predict future costs
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or Price Calculator to get an estimate of potential cloud spend

## Security and Governance
Cloud features that support governance and compliance
- Templates
- Auditing
- Software patches/updates

Cloud providers typically well suited to handle things like DDoS attacks

## Manageability
Automatically scale resources deployment on need
deploy resources based on template
Monitor health of resources
Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics

Tools
- Through a web portal
- Using a command line
- Using APIs
- Using PowerShell

## Cloud Service Types
### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
You are mostly responsible
Need to set up everything that's not hardware (Including OS)

Lift-and-Shift migration
- setting up cloud to be similar to on-prem datacenter (so you can move it onto the cloud)

Testing and Development
- Established environment for testing

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Middle ground
Cloud provider deals with OS, middleware, dev tools, business intelligence services
Don't have to worry about licensing or patching of OS and databases
well suited to complete a dev environment without the headache of maintaining the dev infrastructure

Development framework
- cloud based apps
- typical cloud features

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
least responsibility for the customer
Customer just deals with the data they are storing and what devices can connect, identity management

Scenarios
- Email and messaging
- Office 365
- Finance and Expense tracking

## Cloud Service Providers
1. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
2. Microsoft Azure
3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
