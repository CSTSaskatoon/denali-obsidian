# Azure Architecture and Services
## Azure Accounts
**Subscription** required to create and use azure services
**Azure account** must be created to access azure, subscription required for services
An Azure account can have multiple subscriptions linked to it
Azure resources are created, managed and billed within a single subscription
One account can have multiple subscriptions

### Free Account
Free access to popular Azure products for 12 months
credit is provided to use for the first 30 days
Access to more than 25 products that are always free
Sign up requires **phone number**, **credit card**, **Microsoft** or **GitHub** account
Credit card info is used for verification only

### Saskpoly Azure account
Can create resources
Can access SP Entra ID (read only)
Can create a tenant
Need our own Entra to have read write access, but can't create resources on it

## Resource Groups
Like a container for resources
Could create a VM object (resource) in a resource group
Some resources like VMs require other resources (Ex. vNIC, vDISKs, NSG, Public IP)
Can move resource groups between subscriptions
Think of them like a Windows folder

## Learn Sandbox
Some MS Learn exercises use a technology called sandbox which creates a temporary subscription that's added to an Azure account
Temporary subscription allows creating Azure resources during a learn module
Learn automatically cleans the temporary resources after you're completed

## Azure Physical Infrastructure
- Datacenters - In Regions
- Regions - In Geographies
- Geographies
- Availability Zones
- Region Pairs
- Sovereign Regions

Core components
- Physical Infrastructure
- Management Infrastructure

### Regions
Has at least one datacenter
grouped into geographies
Azure assigns and control resources within each region
when deploying a resource, you usually need to choose the region
Some services are only available in certain regions

**Pairs**
- most regions are paired with another region in the same geography at least 300 miles away
- Allows for the replication of resources that reduces the likelihood of interruptions
- Not all Azure services automatically replicate

### Availability Zones
physically separate datacenters with in each region
made up of one or more datacenters
isolation boundary
if one zone goes down, other continues working
connected through private fiber optic
not all regions currently support them

### Sovereign Regions
Isolated from the main instance of Azure
Used for compliance or legal purposes
US DoD, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa, etc.

## Management Infrastructure
### Resources
Resources are the building blocks of Azure
anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. are resources
Required to place resources in resource groups
Resource can only be in one group
Some resources can be moved from one group to another
Can't nest resource groups

### Subscriptions
unit of management, billing and scale
logically organize resource groups and resources
Authenticated and Authorized access
allows provisioning resources
links to an Azure account, which is an identity in Entra, or in a directory that it trusts

An account can have multiple subscriptions
Define boundaries around products, services and resources

### Management Groups
Multiple subscriptions, may need a way to manage access, policies, and compliance for each subscriptions
Provide a level of scope above subscriptions

### Resource Groups
Fundamental element
Logical container for resources
All resources must be in a resource group

Logical Grouping
Life Cycle
- if a group is deleted, all resources within are also deleted
- Easy to remove lots of resources at once

Authorization
- RBAC to limit access

### Naming Conventions
Understandable and consistent

### Organizing
Could put all resources that are core resources into a resource group, or by type

#### Resource Type
Create a group for all your virtual network, one for all your databases, one for your VMs, etc.

#### Environment Type
Ex. Prod, QA, Dev

#### Department
Ex. Finance, Marketing, HR

#### Combination
Whatever tf you want

#### Authorization
RBAC
Can give permissions on the group for different roles

#### Lifecycle
If you want to delete a bunch of them at one time

#### Billing
If you're billing to different departments/customers
