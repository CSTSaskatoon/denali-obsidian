# Azure Resource Terminology
**Resource** - Anything that we create to work with (manageable item), Ex. VM, web app, database, etc.
**Resource Group** - Container that holds resources
**Resource Provider** - Service that provides resources
**Template** - JSON file that defines one or more resources to deploy in a group
**Declarative Syntax** - "Here's what I want" without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it

### Resource Group Rules
Resources can only exist in one group
Can't be renamed
can have resources of many different types (services)
can have resources from many different regions

### Resource Group Factors
Should share the same lifecycle (deploy, update and delete together)
Each resource can only be in one group
can add or remove a resource to a group at any time
can move a resource to a different group
Can contain resources that reside in different regions
Can scope access control
A resource can interact with resources in other groups

### Configure Resources with Tools
Can do just about everything on the portal

### Cloud Shell
Temporary and requires Azure Fileshare to be mounted
Offers integrated graphical text editor
Authenticates automatically
runs on temporary host provided per session
Times out after 20 minutes of inactivity
Uses the same Azure file share for Bash and PowerShell
persists `$HOME` using a 5 GB image held on your file share
Permissions are as a regular Linux user in Bash

### Templates
**Infrastructure as Code** (Declarative coding)

Define what we want to create in JSON without describing all the commands

#### Example

### Create a virtual Machine
**PowerShell cmdlets**
```PowerShell
# Could do this all in one line, Derrick just split it up with `
New-AzVm `
-ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" `
-Location "canadacentral" ` # locations are always one word, all lowercase
- Name "DemoVM"
```

**It will prompt you for credentials**
```PowerShell
Credential
User: therrien1784
Password for user therrien1784: $Password
```

**Default VM Details**
- Get assigned IP
- 2 CPU Cores
- 8GB RAM
- Windows Installed (2022 Windows Server)
- Don't remember how much storage

Resources for your VM are automatically created in the same resource group when you are finished (NIC, Disk, etc.)

can also create it with the `az` CLI, this one uses `--` instead of `-`
```PowerShell
az vm create --resource-group "ResourceGroupName" --name "ResourceName" --image "Win2022AzureEditionCore" --location "canadacentral"
```

### Other PS Commands
`az account show` - shows your account details in JSON format
`az group create --name "ResourceName" --location "canadacentral"` - creates a resource group with the details you pass
