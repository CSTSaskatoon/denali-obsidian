# Manage Cloud Storage
## Azure Cloud Storage
Azure Storage is Microsoft's cloud storage solution
Provides a file system, messaging store and NoSQL store
Provides file shares for use by some applications
Developers can use working data, websites, mobile apps and desktop apps
Used by IaaS VMs and PaaS cloud services

### Data Categories
VM
- disks and files
- persistent block storage

Unstructured
- least organized
- Can be a mix of information, data doesn't need a clear relationship

Structured
- Relational format such as a schema
- Databases

### Tiers
**Standard**
**Premium**

### Storage Services
- **Blob Storage (Containers)** massively scalable
- **Azure files**
- **Queue Storage** - good for messaging
- **Table Storage** - NoSQL store

#### Blob Storage
- Optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured or non-relational data such as text or binary data
- Streaming audio or video
- data backup
- distributed access to files
- Access via URLs, API, etc.

#### Azure Files
- Traditionally access via Server Message Block (SMB)
- On-premises apps that use file shares
- Configuration files
- Tools and utilities used by multiple developers
- Diagnostic logs, metrics, crash dumps
- Storage account credentials are used to provide authentication
- All users who have the share mounted have full read/write access

#### Queue Storage
- Store and receive messages
- Optimized for this

#### Table Storage
- NoSQL
- Mainly used for Azure Cosmos Database

## Storage account types
- **Standard general-purpose v2** - anything
- **Premium block blobs** - only good for certain types of blob storage
- **Premium file shares** - only good for files
- **Premium page blobs** - only page blobs

## Replication Strategies
Can choose where to replicate your data
- within the same datacenter
- Across zonal datacenters within the same region
- across regions

### Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
- lowest cost
- least durability
- If a datacenter level disaster occurs, all replicas may be lost or unrecoverable

Good if
- Application stores data that can be easily reconstructed if it's lost
- Data is changing constantly, storing it isn't essential
- Application is restricted to replicating only within a country/region

### Zone Redundant Storage
- data replicated across 3 storage clusters in the same region
- physically separate, different availability zones
- Low latency
- Not available in all regions

### Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS/RA-GRS)
- replicates to another region
- highest durability
- Durable even if there's a regional outage
- GRS is read only in the secondary data center
- RA-GRS can read from secondary region regardless of if MS initiates failover from primary to secondary

## Storage Account
- Container that groups services together
- only data services from Azure storage can be included in the storage account
- Combining data services allows managing them as a group
- Settings specific when creating the account apply to all services under the account
- Deleting a storage account deletes all data in it
- Storage account is a resource

### Settings
- **Subscription**
- **Location** (region)
- **Performance** (standard or premium)
- **Replication**
- **Access tier** - hot means you can access the data quicker but it's more expensive
- **Secure Transfer** - without this it will use http
- **Virtual Networks** - Allows inbound access requests only from virtual networks specified

### Deployment Model
- Doesn't really matter anymore
- When azure came out Resource Groups weren't a thing

### Kinds of Accounts
- **StorageV2**
- **StorageV1** - legacy
- **Blob**

### Blob Storage
- Unstructured
- Large amounts of data
- Uses Storage account, Containers in the account, blobs in the container

## Azure Files
- Shared storage for apps using SMB protocol
- Azure VMs and cloud services can share data
- On-premises apps can access file data
- Sync on-premises with Azure files
- Supports NFS as well as SMB (can't use them both at the same time)

### Characteristics
- Stores data as true directory objects
- provides shared access to files
- Any number of VMs or roles can mount and access the files simultaneously
- Process is similar to how a desktop app mounts an SMB file share
- Can be mounted concurrently by cloud, Windows, Linux and macOS

### Azure Files vs Blobs
![](Pasted%20image%2020250204081118.png)

### Types
- Standard and premium
- Mostly just premium = SSD, standard = HDD
- NFS can only be used on premium

### Important settings
- Open port 445 on the client computer
- Enable secure transfer

### Snapshots
- capture a point in time
- read only copy of data
- incremental (only shows what files have changed)
- Have to delete all of them if you want to delete the share

## Security Strategies
- Encryption - automatically done
- Data in transit - automatically encrypted
- Disk encryption - not done by default, can be done on VMs
- Authentication
- Shared access signatures
- Authorization

### Auth Options
- Entra - most granular, can use RBAC
- Shared key - creates 2 512 bit keys for every storage account, share them with clients - **Grant anyone the equivalent of root**, use the key vault
- Shared access signatures - granular access, only valid for a certain amount of time
- Anonymous/Public access - can make containers and blob resources public
