Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Configure access to applications
- SSO
- Managing users and groups
- Provisioning users
- Enabling federation between organizations
- Identity Management
- Sign in activity
- MFA
- App proxy for cloud and local apps
- Conditional access

Basic service, **always included in an Azure subscription**
Comes with a default tenant named **Default Directory**
Focused on providing identity management for web-based apps more than on-premises
Azure subscription must be associated with one and only one MS Entra Tenant
Can associate one Tenant with multiple subscriptions

### Tenant Names
Every tenant assigned the default Domain Name System (DNS) domain name consisting of a unique prefix
followed by `onmicrosoft.com`

### Entra Schema
Contains fewer object types than AD DS
Process is much different from joining computers to AD DS
Very extensible
Can't use traditional computer management techniques such as Group Policy Objects
Handles authentication and authorization of users, devices and apps
Doesn't include the Organizational Unit class which means you can't arrange objects into a hierarchy of custom contains which is very common in on-premises AD DS deployments
- Can group things but can't do hierarchy like in AD DS

### AD DS vs Entra ID
Entra isn't meant to be a replacement for AD DS
User can use MS Entra ID independently of Windows AD
Smaller companies can use Entra ID as their only directory service to control access to apps and SaaS products
If you have both set up, they don't talk to each other automatically, have to use Entra Connect to sync things

## Characteristics of AD DS
Traditional deployment of windows Server based AD on a physical or virtual server
- True directory service, hierarchical X.500 based structure
- uses DNS for locating resources
- Can query and manage AD DS by using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) calls
- Primarily uses Kerberos for Auth
- Uses OUs and GPOs for management
- uses computer objects representing computers to join an AD DS domain
- Uses trusts between domains for "Delegated management"

Can deploy AD DS on an Azure virtual machine to enable scalability and availability for on-premises AD DS, but it doesn't use Entra ID in that case

## Characteristics of Entra ID
Primarily an Identity solution, designed for internet based Applications using HTTP and HTTPS communications
Multi-tenant directory service
Users and groups are created in a flat structure, no OUs or GPOs
Can't query using LDAP, stead use the REST API over HTTPS
Doesn't use Kerberos, instead uses HTTPS protocols like SAML, WS-Federation and OpenID Connect for Authentication and OAuth for Authorization
Uses Federation Services and many third-party services such as Facebook are federated with and trusted in Entra ID

## Entra ID as a Directory Service for cloud apps
Cloud service such as MS365 or Intune need to have directory services in the cloud to provide authentication and authorization for services
Each cloud service that needs authentication will create it's own Entra Tenant
When a single organization uses more than one cloud service it's convenient for the cloud service to use a single cloud directory
Provides devs with centralized authentication and authorization
SSO
Enable Entra Authentication for Web Apps through the Azure Portal

## Plans
**P1**
- Self service group management that simplifies administration
	- Users given rights to create and manage groups
	- End users can request to join groups
- MFA
- Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) licensing
- Enterprise SLA of 99.9%
- Self service password reset
- Cloud app discovery
- Conditional access based on device, group and location
- Entra Connect Health works with alerts, performance counters, usage patterns, etc.

**P2**
- All P1 features
- Can define user risk policies and sign in policies
- Review user behavior and flag for risk
- Configure additional privileged users such as Admins

## Entra Domain Service Limitations
Only base computer AD object is supported
Not possible to extend the schema
Organizational unit structure is flat (no nesting)
Built in GPO and exists for computer and user accounts (limited)
Not possible to target OUs with Built in GPOs
Can't use Windows Management Instrumentation filters or security group filtering
Doesn't automatically communicate with AD DS

## Configure Subscriptions
Entra ID incudes an instance of Entra ID as a default directory which holds users and groups that have access to each of the services the company has purchased
tenant represents an organization and the default directory assigned to it
Azure subscription is both a billing entity and a security boundary
- Resources are associated with a single subscription
- Each subscription has a single owner
- Can transfer the subscription to another account

Can add users and groups to multiple subscriptions
User can create, access and control resources in their subscription


## Azure Regions
Made up of datacenters around the world
Organized and made available to end users by region
Region is a geographical area on the planet containing one or more datacenters
Datacenters are in close proximity and networked together via a low-latency network

### Things to Consider
Plan which region you want to deploy your resources in
Know what services are supported where
Some services are global and don't require a region
There are exceptions to region pairing
Data resiliency with region pairs

## Azure Subscriptions
Logical unit of services linked to an Azure account
Account is an identity in Entra ID or a directory that is trusted by Entra ID
Organize services and resources, control billing
Required to use Azure
Enterprise agreement is paying money up front

Most Common
- Free
- Pay as you go
- Enterprise agreement
- Student

### Things to Consider
Azure for free doesn't last very long
Pay as you go charges you based on only the services you use
Enterprise Agreement is target to large organizations, discounts and software assurance
Azure for students lasts longer but you don't have very many credits
Can pay for things up front to save a lot of money

## Azure Policy
Allows you to create policies that create control and audit resources
enforce different rules over resource configurations
Main advantages are enforcement, compliance, scaling and remediation
Important for teams that require different levels of governance

### Management Groups
Useful if you have **multiple subscriptions**
Level and scope above subscriptions
Can be multilevel and hierarchical up to 6 levels
RBAC authorization for management group operations isn't enabled by default
By default all new subscriptions are placed in a root group

Management Groups -> Subscriptions -> Resource Groups -> Resources

### Creating
Definition describes compliance conditions for resources and the actions to complete when conditions are met (like an event handler)
Grouped into an **initiative definition** to control the **scope** of policies and "elevate the compliance of resources"

#### Example
```JSON
{
	"properties": {
		"displayName": "Allowed Locations",
		"description": "blah blah blah",
		"mode": "Indexed",
		"metadata": {
			"version": "1.0.0",
			"category": "Locations"
		},
		"defaultValue": [
			"westus2"
		]
	}
},
"policyRule": {
	"if": {
		"not": {
			"field": "location",
			"in": "[parameters('allowedLocations)]"
		}
	},
	"then": {
		"effect": "deny"
	}
}
```

### Built in Policy Definitions
Disable public network access
Allowed locations

## Create, Configure and Manage Identities
Default directory created when a company signs up for something like Azure, M365, Intune or Dynamics which holds users and groups and all services the company signs up for
- Can refer to this as a tenant
- Tenant represents the organization and the default directory assigned to it

A subscription in Azure is a **Billing entity** and **Security Boundary**
Resources such as VMs, websites, and databases are associated with a single subscription
Each subscription also has a single account owner responsible for any charges incurred by resources in that subscription
If an organization wants a subscription billed to another account they can transfer the subscription
A subscription is associated with a single Entra directory
Multiple subscriptions can trust the same directory, but a subscription can only trust one directory

### Switching Directories
Can switch between multiple directories
- Select **switch directory** in the portal setting

Can decide how the default directory is selected - last visited or specific
Can set the default filter for displayed subscriptions
Default filters are useful if you have access to several subscriptions, but typically only work in a few of them

## Create and Manage Users
Every user accessing Azure needs an account
A user account contains all auth info
Get an access token once signed in

### View Users
Within your tenant Users are **Cloud Identities** and exist only in Entra (Ex. Administrator account you create)
**Directory Synchronized Identities** exist only on on-premises AD
- Use MS Entra Connect

**Guest Users** exist outside Azure, other cloud providers (Ex. Xbox Live Account)
- Useful when dealing with external vendors/contractors that need to access Azure resources

### Add Users
Options
- Syncing on-premises
- Entra Admin center
- Azure Portal
- Command Line

## Create and Manage Groups
Organize users
Groups let the resource owner assign a set of access permissions to all group members
Allows you define a security boundary and then add/remove specific users
Define membership based on rules such as their department or job title

### Group Membership
Assigned - You pick
Dynamic - based on rules (Ex. your department, job title, location, etc.)
- Access removed if the rule is no longer met in the future (Ex. move departments)
- Requires P1 license

Dynamic Device - based on rules about the device
- Requires P1 license

## Entra Registered Devices
Made for BYOD policies
Often used in combination with Intune

## Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
Azure RBAC is an authorization system that provides access to resources
children inherit permissions by default

What you can do
- Allow users to access different things
- Allow a database admin to manage SQL databases in a subscription
- Allow a user to manage all resources in a resource group

Role assignment
- Security Principle (Who) - User, group or application
- Role Definition (What) - Collection of permissions (can be referred to as just role), could be something like CRUD 
	- Built in roles are Owner, Contributor (CRUD but can't grant access), Reader, User Access Administrator
- Scope (Where)
