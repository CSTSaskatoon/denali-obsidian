# Manage Cloud Compute Services
### Virtual Machines
- IaaS model
- can have it's own OS and networking
- Quickly scale up/down

### Azure Resource
- VMs have several required components (basically like an empty computer)
- Azure creates all the resources necessary
- Each resource has a name
- Azure uses the VM name to create the resource name

#### Network
- For on-prem, what does the server communicate with, what ports are open?
- Virtual Networks are used in Azure to provide private connectivity between VMs and resources
- By default the outside virtual network can't connect to services inside it
- Can configure network to access external services

##### Segregation
- Can create subnets on your virtual network
- Azure reserves the first 4 addresses and the last address in each subnet

#### Location
- Put it close to your users
- Keep in mind legal, compliance and tax implications
- Can limit available options

#### Sizes
- General Purpose
- Compute Optimized
- Memory Optimized
- Storage Optimized
- GPU
- High Performance Compute

#### Storage
- OS - Labeled as `C:\` on Windows, SATA drive
- Temporary - may be lost during maintenance, data should persist if you restart the VM
- Data disks (optional) - registered SCSI drive, stores app data

#### Scale Sets
- Load balancing for VMs
- Number of VMs can automatically increase/decrease
- High availability
- No cost for the scale set itself, only pay for the instances you create

#### Connecting
- SSH
- RDP
- Cloud Shell
- Azure Bastion (costs more, but more secure)

##### Azure Bastion
- PaaS
- VMs don't need a public IP
- Protects machines form exposing SSH and RDP ports

### VM Statuses
- Starting
- Running
- Stopping
- Stopped
- Deallocating
- Deallocated - won't be billed for the VM, removes it from the Hypervisor

### Hardware Maintenance and Downtime
- **Unplanned** - detect something is about to fail, live migration migrates VMs from the failing hardware to a healthy machine
- **Unexpected** - something fails unexpectedly, can include local network, disk or other rack level failures.
	- VMs will experience downtime
- **Planned** - periodic updates made by Microsoft

#### Availability Sets
- Group of related VMs are deployed together
- Helps prevent single point of failure

##### Characteristics
- Perform the same functionalities
- Have the same software
- Run across multiple physical servers, compute racks, storage units and network switches
- If a hardware or software failure occurs, only a subset of the VMs are affected, app stays up
- Can only be modified when you are creating the VM, after that it's set in stone

##### Considerations
- **Redundancy**
- **Separation of Application Tiers** - each app on a separate availability set
- **Load Balancing** - high availability

#### Update Domains and Fault Domains
- Each VM in an availability set is placed in one *Update Domain* and one *Fault Domain*

##### Update Domains
- Group of nodes that are upgraded together during the process of a service upgrade or rollout
- Allows incremental updates

##### Fault Domains
- group of nodes that represent a single point of failure
- Ex. server rack
- Two fault domains work together to mitigate against hardware failures

### Availability Zones
- High availability
- Combination of fault domain and update domain

#### Characteristics
- Unique physical locations within a region

### Scaling
- **Horizontal vs Vertical** = **Scale out vs Scale up**

#### Considerations
- Horizontal has fewer limitations
- Vertical scaling usually requires the VM to restart
- Horizontal scaling is more flexible

#### Scale Sets
- Deploy and manage identical VMs
- automatically increases the number of VM instances (horizontal)
- process of adding and removing instances can be done manually or automatically
- All VM instances are created from the same base OS image
- *Azure Load Balancer* Uses layer 4 traffic distribution, *Azure Application Gateway* uses layer 7

## App Services
### App Service Plan
- SaaS because you just pick what you want and then manage your software
- Defines compute resources for an app to run
- Similar to a server farm in traditional web hosting
- Can pick: OS, Region, Pricing Tier, Number of VM instances, Size of VM instances

#### Pricing Tiers
- **Shared Compute** - Run an app on the same VM as other app service apps, including other customers
- **Dedicated Compute** - Only apps in the same plan have the same compute resources
- **Isolated** - you get your own network as well as plan

## Containers
- VMs are hardware virtualization
- Containers are OS virtualization

### Orchestration
- Manage containers

### Image Components
- Created from container images
- Lightweight, standalone application
- Includes: Code, Runtime, System tools, etc.

### Groups
- Top level resource in container instances
- Same lifecycle as the containers
- share resources and storage with containers
- Similar to a pod in Kubernetes
