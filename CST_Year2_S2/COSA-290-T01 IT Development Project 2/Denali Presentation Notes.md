## Intro, Background, Development Process - **Shane**

## Tech Stack - **Denali**

#### Our Tech Stack
- When we were creating the app, we had to decide what technologies to use.
- Because the app is mobile first, we chose `Flutter` as our frontend framework.
- frontend is the part of the app the user interacts with
- We chose `ASP.NET` core as our backend framework
- backend is like a middle man between the interface and the data, allows us to have more granular control and security
- Firebase is used for our database

##### Flutter
- `Flutter` is a mobile-first framework made by Google and makes it simple to create the apps for multiple different platforms.
- it's is great for building mobile apps, and we wanted to learn technologies we hadn't used in class

##### ASP.NET Core
- `ASP.NET` is made by Microsoft
- We used it as our backend by accepting API calls and interacting with Firebase.
- We chose it because `C#` is an industry standard language, and we all had experience in it.

##### Firebase
- Made by google
- Firestore is a NoSQL database
- We chose it because it integrates well with Flutter and it's a new technology

## App Features
### Intro - **Denali**
- The app has authentication and authorization to enhance security, which Seth will talk more about.
- The purpose of the app is to gather data about patient's progress with hippotherapy, which Aron will go over.
- As a therapist or owner, you have the ability to view the data via the graph and comparison pages, which Jaxon will talk about.
- Finally, Gia will explain how to export data from the app.

### Authentication and Authorization - **Seth**

## Summary - **Gia**
- Wishlist of what we would want to do in the future (plans going forward if we were to maintain it)

## Deployment
- We chose to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to deploy the app because we did not have access to on-premises infrastructure, and I had used it in the past so I figured I would have a leg up on it.
- I could talk for hours about all the pieces of the deployment, but to keep it short I'll just say: 'It is what allows people to visit a web page and use the app'.
