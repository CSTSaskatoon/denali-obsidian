### Endianness
Two common schemes for arranging bytes
- Big-Endian - most significant byte at the smallest memory address
- Little-Endian - least significant byte at the smallest memory address

Ex. Given `int x = 999999999`, we plug into the programmer calculator to see that in hexadecimal it is `3B9A C9FF`
- `3B` is the most significant byte, `FF` is the least significant byte

#### Big-Endian machine

| Variable | Memory Address (Going Up) | Value In hex |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
|          | 0x0012FF83                | FF           |
|          | 0x0012FF82                | C9           |
|          | 0x0012FF81                | 9A           |
| int x    | 0x0012FF80                | 3B           |

#### Little-Endian machine
What we work on in `x86` and `x64`

| Variable | Memory Address (Going Up) | Value In hex |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
|          | 0x0012FF83                | 3B           |
|          | 0x0012FF82                | 9A           |
|          | 0x0012FF81                | 9C9          |
| int x    | 0x0012FF80                | FF           |

Note that memory is byte-addressable (we can access the value of each individual byte)
Recall that 1 byte is 8 bits (2 hexadecimal digits)

## Area Memory in C
Variables are stored in one of four locations in RAM, depending on how they're declared
1. Data area - used for global variables that are initialized to a value other than 0
2. BSS Segment (Don't worry about what BSS stands for) - used for global variables that are not initialized (defaults to 0)
3. Heap - Dynamically allocating memory (done in runtime), this is where the `new` keyword in C# and Java puts things. C uses `malloc` and others
4. Stack - used for variables that are declared within a function or for the function's parameters (everything on stack frame)

### Detailed
Why are there two areas for global variables? When a C program starts up, but before the C library calls your `main` function, it sets all bytes in BSS to `0`. In the data area, the C library sets the individual variables to their initial values, again before calling `main`

### Quiz
Given the following program, in what area of RAM are each of the variables stored?
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int globalVar;
double pi = 3.141591;

main()
{
	char c;
}
```
`globalVar` - BSS (global variables, not initialized, defaults to 0)
`pi` - Data Area (global variable, initialized to a value other than 0)
`c` - Stack (declared in a function, not using malloc or other memory allocation function)

### Static Variables
Special kind of variable called a static variable, but different from global variables defined using the `static` keyword.
A static variable is defined in a function, is only known within that function, but exists for the lifetime of the program
Rather than being allocated to the stack, memory for static variables is stored in either BSS or Data Area (same as global variables)
They work just like global variables, but their scope is limited to the function they are declared in

It's good practice to limit the scope of variables - when you use them, static variables are better than global variables

**TLDR; static variables will remain the same if you exit and go back into a function**

## More on the Stack
Every time a function is called, the program does a number of things
- Pushes the address of the current instruction to the stack
- Reserves space on top of the stack for return values
- Pushes the values of parameters onto the stack
- Allocates space on top of the stack for all variables defined in the function

The specific details about how this is done is different between compilers and operating systems
- Typically defined in the Application binary interface (ABI), specifically the "Calling Conventions" of an ABI
- Collectively this information for each function is called a **Stack Frame**

Suppose we have a program such as
```c
func1()
{
	int someValue;
	// Do something...
}

func2()
{
	int anotherValue;
	func1();
}

main()
{
	int someValue;
	func1();
	func2();
}
```
The stack will contain frames for each called function as the function is called and the stack frames will be popped off the stack when execution of the function is completed

### Important stuff to Know
Local variables are allocated on the stack
Local variables may occupy different memory locations every time a function is called
Local variables may have leftover
