# Denali's CST Notes
- Brody and Seth's notes can be found in certain classes.
- Written in Obsidian, I recommend to either view these in Obsidian after downloading the repository, using VSCode with some extensions or viewing them in the browser on GitHub. Obsidian has a really good search feature so if you are looking for some random phrase or definition I would use that.
- Some of the earlier classes are missing things such as screenshots as I only started committing pictures to the repository later on
- These notes are purely for studying purposes, I have removed all references to assignments, exams, etc.
- You are welcome to fork this repo and do whatever you see fit with it, just don't un-archive this repo.
- The main benefit of note-taking is it being easier to recall information from lectures afterwards so I advise you create your own notes in addition to these.
- Lastly, this is probably a lot of your first introduction to the CST Saskatoon GitHub Organisation (Where this is being hosted), so if you are interested in exploring the other 50+ code repositories we have created (which are private), DM `@karbn` on Discord with your GitHub username/email and I can add you to the organisation.
