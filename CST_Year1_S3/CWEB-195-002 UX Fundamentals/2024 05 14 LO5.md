# Design Principles
Websites should be *attractive*, *distinctive*, and *easy to read/follow*
### Four Basic Principles *(CRAP)*
#### Contrast
Should be distinct differences between elements on the page
- Color contrast (readability)
- Different Fonts (header vs body text)
- Differences in font sizes, boldness, etc.
- Differences to indicated where links are on the page
#### Repetition
Use the same elements/styles in different places on the page/site/application
#### Alignment
People's eyes follow lines so line up related information
Centering is a *weak alignment*
Sometimes aligning elements at the right edge is interesting and distinctive
#### Proximity
Put pieces of related close to each other
Put gaps between unrelated information or to create groups
