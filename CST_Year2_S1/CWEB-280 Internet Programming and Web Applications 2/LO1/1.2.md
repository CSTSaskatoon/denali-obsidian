### Dynamic vs static sites
On a static site, the user sends a request to the server and gets all the html/js/css files they need to able to run the entire website. On a dynamic site, they only send a request and get the files/render the page that they are currently visiting (Ex. index.html), and the way that it loads depends on things like the user's set preferences, cookies, etc.
