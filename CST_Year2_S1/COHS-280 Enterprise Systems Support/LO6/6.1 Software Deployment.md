# Software Deployment
Want deployment to be *cost efficient* and *automated*

## Guidelines
- *Inventory and Network Map*
- *Hardware Evaluation* - what needs to be retired?
- *Application Redeployment* - what are we still using?
- *Application Compatibility* - might need virtualization to keep using certain apps
- *Cost Reduction*
- *User Data/Settings*
- *Data Backup*
- *Deployment Process* - define an end-to-end process (documentation)
- *User Training*

## Readiness Tools
*Intune*
*Endpoint Analytics*
- Cloud based
- supports devices managed by Configuration Manager but doesn't require it
- Identifies devices capable of running Windows 11

## Application Compatibility
*OS Compatible*
Generally apps and hardware from Windows 7 and 8.1 are compatible with Windows 11 or later

Common issues
- security-class apps
- Low-level kernel calls
- Architecture changes (32 bit apps on 64 bit OS)
- Legacy apps

### Assessing App compatibility
Discover - What apps are **required** to work
Rationalize - do we still need these legacy apps?
Prioritize
Test
Mitigate issues

### Mitigation Methods
App config modifications
Apply app updates
Upgrade the app
Security configuration adjustments
Run the app in a VM
Use compatibility features
Alternative app

When issues can't be resolved with updates/configurations, there may be alternative methods

### Software Lifecycle
*Preparation*
*Deployment*
*Maintenance*
*Removal*

### Advantages
Integrated with GP and AD DS, no additional costs
No client/agent software required
Reduced training costs

### Disadvantages
Limited features
- No control over install timing, order, or reboot behavior
- No reporting for success/failure
- Only supports MSI Packages
- May not scale well for organizations with more than 500 devices

Recommended to use Configuration Manager for larger organizations

### Windows Installer Service
*Automates application installation/removal by processing `.msi` files*

Elevated permissions
Automatically detects and repairs corruption

### Upgrades
Include patches (`.msp` files)
Redeploy packages if original MSI is modified

### Assign and Publish Software
Assign
- Mandatory
- Admin puts software on machine
- Can assign to users or computers
- Ideal when you have licensing issues

Publish
- Optional
- Can only do it to users, not computers

### Adding Software to a GPO
Add it to the software Installation Node

### App Categories in Intune
Organize apps in company portal
9 Default categories
Can create custom categories

### Deploying Applications with Intune
Challenges
- Device platforms and app types
- Managing apps on company owned and personal owned devices
- Maintaining network and data security

### Intune App Lifecycle
Add -> Deploy -> configure -> protect -> Retire

### App types
*Store Apps*
- Provider does maintenance and updates

*M365 Apps*

*Web Link Apps*
- Hosted online

*Built In Apps*

*Line of Business (LOB)*
- Uploaded via installation files (`.msi`, `.appx`, `.appxbundle`, `.msix`, `.apk`, `.ipa`, `.intunemac`)

*Windows App (Win32)*
- for Win32 LOB apps
- Done through Intune Management Extension

### MS Store for Business
Being deprecated
Produce apps for your organization, either individually or in bulk

### Updating MS Store Apps with Intune
- Security, stability, UE
- Prevents compatibility issues
- optimize performance and reduces application crashes

### App Updates in Intune
**Universal Windows Platform (UWP)**
**Win32 Apps (Preview)**
- User action needed
- Company portal
- `.exe` and `.msi`

**Installer Context**

### Store Group Policy Restrictions
may effect app deployments from the MS Store

### Assigning Apps in Intune
Can assign to user or device groups
Can make it required or optional
Can specify only for enrolled devices
