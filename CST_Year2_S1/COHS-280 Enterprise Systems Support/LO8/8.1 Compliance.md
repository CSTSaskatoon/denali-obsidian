# Device Compliance
Restricting access to email and documents to devices that are complying with the policy
devices not enrolled in Intune can't be evaluated for compliance

## Purpose and Functionality
Define rules and settings
monitor compliance status
Enforce policies
- Password requirements
- Data encryption
- Jailbreak/root detection
- minimum/maximum OS version
- etc.

## Integration and use
Compliance status is reported to Intune and stored in MS Entra ID upon device enrollment

## Noncompliance actions
By default it's flagged
can config it to send and email, and have a grace period

## Dynamic Groups with MS Entra ID
Recommended for applying policies
Membership rules include Property, Operator and Value

## Requirements
MS Entra ID P1 or P2 and Intune

## General Compliance Settings
mark compliance with no compliance policy assigned as
- Not compliant (default)
- Compliant
- Recommended

Enhanced Jailbreak detection (iOS)
- requires location services enabled and user consent

## Protect Access to Resources using Intune
many orgs are using M365 to protect their identities with MFA and Conditional Access
Device compliancy is another way to secure your network

## What is Device Compliance
Endpoints are one of the 6 key elements in a zero-trust approach
Once an identity is granted access to your resources, data from those resources can flow to the endpoint
Can be a large attack surface

## Device Compliance Policies
Define rules/settings
Monitor compliance
allow an admin to configure requirements for devices to be considered compliant or non-compliant
Intune evaluates the devices

## Zero Trust Model
Assume breach and verifies each request as if it originates from an open network
Evaluating and enforcing everything before letting anything in

## Device Compliance to protect your organization
Intune shares device compliance
Block access to resources if user is accessing them through a non-compliant device

## Conditional Access
Feature of Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)
Provides more granular access control
Protects company email and data from non-compliant devices
Users prompted to enroll device and resolve compliance issues if it's not compliant
Can restrict access to anything domain joined/intune enrolled

## Policy Definition
When this happens (condition) then do this

## Use Cases
Requiring MFA for certain apps/untrusted networks
Restrict M365 to trusted devices
Enforces compliance without hindering productivity

## Creating Conditional Access Policies
Conditions - rules Intune evaluates
Actions - allowing or blocking access

## Exchange Active Sync (EAs)
Exchange sync protocol
Optimized for high-latency, low-bandwidth networks
Allows mobile devices to access email, calendar, contacts, tasks from an Organization's exchange server, continue accessing this info online
By default it's enabled, and all users with an Exchanged mailbox and sync their mobile devices
Provides encryption including SSL
