# Describe Enterprise Desktop
## Enterprise Desktops
Used to be organization owned, shared/assigned to an employee. Today it can be
- Computer
- Laptop
- Phone
- Tablet

Either owned by the company or the employee

## Modern Management Benefits
Microsoft wants to phase out AD/On site servers?
Nowadays a lot of stuff is on the cloud, and BYOD is more common
Modern Endpoint management allows you to
- *Simplify* deployment and management
- improve security
- Provide better end-user experiences
- *Lower costs* for Windows devices
- Manage devices such as Desktops, HoloLens, Surface Hubs, company owned devices, employee-owner devices, and mobile devices running iOS or Android

## Modern Management Pillars
"Easy to deploy and manage"
*- Windows autopilot*
- Intune applies preferences and security settings without OS images
- Traditional OS deployment was powerful but time consuming

Always up to date
"Intelligent" security built in
- Attackers become more sophisticated
- Windows Hello
- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)
- Windows Information Protection
- Azure AD Identity Protection
- Conditional Access

Microsoft Security Graph
- Uses lots of signals to improve machine learning algorithms
- human expertise to protect company data and respond to sophisticated attacks

Proactive insights
- Rich telemetry

**Enterprise Desktop Model**
- Plan -> Purchase -> Deploy -> Operate -> Support -> Upgrade -> Retire
- **PP DOS UR**

## Planning and Purchasing
Computer policies
- Image and hardware standardization
- Environment Design
- Replacement frequency
- Mobile device vs desktop usage
- BYOD

Computer selection
- Hardware, software, peripherals
- Desktop config
- Application compatibility testing

Deployment methods
- Multiple methods for different scenarios
- Cloud based or not?

Demand forecasting
- Predict the future computing resources

Design config
- New features and how to incorporate them

### Decisions that affect the cost
*Hardware*
*Software*
*Accessories*
*Deployment Process*
- Keep storage in mind

*Hardware Staging*

## Desktop Deployment
*Building*
*Testing*
- VMs can be used, but also test physical

*Configuration*
*Managing Logistics*
*Deployment
- Make sure it's stable

*Enrollment*
- Existing devices added to the organization
- Windows 10 and later you can use autopilot
- BYOD

*Data Migration*
- Data loss is not acceptable
- Cloud minimizes data migration
- Best practices
	- migrate essential data to a cloud/non-local solution before deployment
	- Use in-place upgrades where possible
	- Use the user state migration tool

## Application Deployment
3 Phases
- Managing Application inventory and compatiblity
- Packaging Applications
- Life-cycle support

*Application Inventory*
- should have an accurate inventory
- consider standardizing applications

*Packaging*
- Deploying new applications, new versions and updating

*Delivery*
- Can be installed automatically or on demand through a portal

*Microsoft Intune*
- customers manage their app deployments
- Supports BYOD policies

*Virtual Application Delivery*
- Client can't run the app
- installed on server/cloud PC and used remotely

## Upgrades and Retirement
Consider the age of the computers, their performance, cost of upgrading
*Retirement*
- Focuses on removing a system from production
- Don't interrupt daily organizational business
- Consider picking up the computer, prepare computers for reselling, update inventory, packing/shipping duties

*BYOD and Unenrollment*
- Intune can selectively wipe and remove app data as long as the app supports the capabilities
- in some BYOD situations, users won't accept IT wiping the device
- Should have a *policy for data removal*
