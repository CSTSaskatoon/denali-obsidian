## Terminology
*Endpoint* - client device
*Managed Endpoints* - endpoints that receive policies from the organization using an MDM solution/Group Policy Objects. Typically organization owned, but can be BYOD
*Cloud Native Endpoints* - Endpoints joined to Microsoft Entra (Not on-premises AD)
*Workload* - Program, service or process

## High Level View
- Manage devices using cloud-native MDM provider
- Review your endpoint and user workloads
- Transition your workloads in phases
- Transition your organization in phases
- Move from Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- Using windows Autopilot

## Paths to Modern Management
Having a single management solution for all endpoints is the main benefit of using unified endpoint management.
The concept is not new but Covid sped it along
BYOD trends have also compelled companies to move quicker.

## Digital Transformation
Windows Autopilot
- Collection of technologies to set up and pre-configure devices
- Can be used to reset, repurpose and recover devices

Co-management (uses some on-premises and some cloud)
- Can manage on-premises servers

MS Intune
- 100% cloud based
- Manage user access, simplifies app and device management

### Using Co-Management to transition
Moving to modern management can be complex
- Most companies still use a combination of on-premises AD and Configuration manager

## MS Entra ID
- SSO across cloud and on-premises resources
- Secure access to the cloud and on-premises resources with conditional access (Accessing sharepoint or exchange online)

## Co-Management Prerequisites
Devices must be configured as MS Entra hybrid joined devices
- create required organizational units in MS Entra Connect for any objects belonging to a specific organizational unit
- Intune MDM must be set up
- MS Endpoint Manager
- AD joined using Windows 10 version 1709+
- MS Entra automatic Enrollment enabled

## MS Entra ID Joined
- Factory Reset
- Selective Wipe
- Delete Devices
- Restart Device
- Fresh Start

## Transition Workloads to Intune
Start with devices with simple configs
Workloads include
- Resource access profiles (Email, WiFi, VPN, Certificates)
- Windows Update Policies
- Endpoint Protection
- Device configuration (Group Policy Settings)
- MS 365 Select to run apps (Company portal)

## Modern Management Considerations
Instead of completely wiping existing data and replacing it, we have other options
goal is to make modern deployment faster and more efficient
Newer methods must have Windows 11
For devices running a different OS traditional methods must be used

## Modern Deployment
Can be installed on Windows 11 in many ways
- Removing pre-installed software
- Upgrading a windows 11 edition
- Joining W11 devices to AD DS or MS Entra ID
- Enrolling a W11 devices with MDM
- Restricting Admin account creation
- Creating/auto assigning devices config groups
- Customizing Out of Box Experience (OOBE) content specific to the organization

## The Plan
![](Pasted%20image%2020240923082745.png)

After you have considered the requirements, you have two options
- Migration of existing technologies
- Adoption of modern technologies right from the start

## Upgrades and Migrations
Device migration is like deploying a new device
Decide to use traditional or autopilot
- Consider the user's data

Scenarios
- Device is being replaced
- Upgrading OS where in-place upgrade isn't possible
- Clean install is needed

## Migration Considerations
![](Pasted%20image%2020240923083234.png)
### In-place upgrades
Windows Autopilot
Only relevant if it fits into your overall approach

## Migrate data when modern transitioning
Know what settings should be saved
- Sync user state (Enterprise State Roaming)
- Migrate user state (User State Management Tool)
- Known Folder Move - Use OneDrive for common folders

## Migrate Workloads
Migrate Client management to Intune
Smaller organizations should consider moving to 100% cloud based if

## Workloads within Endpoint Manager
Large organizations may still want some On-premises configurations
- Company may have several hundred application packages with extensive settings and compliance policies (Only do it if you get value)
- Some workloads have clear value
	- Using Autopilot for OS Deployment
	- Applications like office are easy to do
