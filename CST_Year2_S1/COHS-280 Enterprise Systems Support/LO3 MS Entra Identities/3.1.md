## Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
storing data such as user accounts, passwords, data available to network users
Runs as service domain controller

## Entra ID
Cloud based identity and access management
Platform as a service (PaaS)
- Not part of the core infrastructure
- Not a infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offering

new features such as
- Multifactor auth
- identity protection
- self-service password reset

Formally called Azure AD

Can be configured to provide my access
- Configure access to applications
- Configure SSO to cloud based SaaS applications
- Managing users and groups
- Provisioning users
- Federation between organizations
- Identity management solution
- Multifactor auth

Any new Azure subscription includes automatically, don't incur any extra cost and is referred to as the free tier
When you subscribe to any MS online services (M365 or Intune) you get Entra ID
Subscription includes a MS Entra Tenant

### Tenants
Entra ID is multi-tenant by design, implemented to ensure isolation
Worlds largest multi-tenant directory

*Tenant*
- Represents dedicated instance of Entra ID for your organization
- Automatically created
- Typically represents a company or organization
- With an Azure subscription, you can make multiple Tenants

Azure subscription must be associated with one any one Entra tenant
You can use the same Entra tenant with multiple Azure subscriptions
When a user signs up for a cloud service, a new Entra tenant is created (Made global Admin)
Users have a single auth home directory, they can participate as guests in multiple directories

Each tenant is assigned the default DNS Domain name (Ex. saskpolytech.onmicrosoft.com)
Tenant serves as the security boundary and a container for Entra objects like users, groups and applications

### Schema
Fewer object types than AD DS
Does not include a definition of the computer class but does have a device class
Joining devices to entra is very different from AD DS
Extensivle and extensions are reversible
Doesn't use GPOs
Define a concept of computer management

### Apps and Service Principles
Objects of the **Application** and **servicePortal** classes represent applications

#### Example
Illustrates the relationship between an application's object and the corresponding service principle objects using a sample multitenant application called HR App
**Adaptum** - company
**Contoso** - consumer of the app
**Fabrikam** - also consumes the app
