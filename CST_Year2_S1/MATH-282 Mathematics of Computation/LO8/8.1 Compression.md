The transmission and storage of multimedia material requires compression.
All compression schemas require two algorithms - One for compression (encoding) and one for decompression (decoding)

### Considerations
The algorithms for encoding and decoding may be **asymmetrical**. 
- for example, when compressing a movie, it may be acceptable to have a slow/expensive system for encoding and a fast/cheap system for decoding
- The reason is a movie is the movie is encoded once but decoded every time the movie is viewed.
- On the other hand, video conferencing would require fast/cheap algorithms for both encoding and decoding (**symmetrical**)

The encode/decode process might not be **invertible**.
- For example, when encoding an image the image might not be 100% identical to the original.
- In some cases, this is acceptable and the system is said to be **lossy** (for example, JPEG and MP3)
- If input and output are 100% match, the system is said to be **lossless** (for example, PNG, ZIP)

### Compression Schemes

#### Entropy Encoding
generally manipulate the bit stream **without** regard for what the bits mean
Usually lossless

##### Run-length encoding
in many multimedia data, repeated symbols are common. 
In audio, silence is represented by a string of 0s, in video, runs of the same color are common in things such as the sky. 
These repeated symbols can be replaced by a special number (not otherwise allowed in the data), followed by the number of times it's occurred. 

Consider the follow strings of data
- ![](Pasted%20image%2020241206083858.png)
- Special marker $\color{red} A$
- $\color{blue} \text{Repeated character}$
- $\color{green} \text{Number of occurrences}$ and consists of 3 digits in this example (padded with 0s)
- The compression ratio achieved in this example is $16/32 = 50\%$

##### Color lookup table
Consider an RGB image encoded with 3 bytes per pixel (24-bit color)
In theory, there are $2^{24}$ colors (about 16 million), but in practice there may be fewer values in a specific image.
For example, suppose a picture is made up of 256 actual colors. Each pixel is then represented as an index into the color table (each index only requiring 8 bits since $2^8 = 256$)

#### Source Encoding
Takes advantage of the properties of the data to produce compression
Usually lossy
Ex. MP3 files or other audio compression techniques will eliminate parts of the sound that humans can't usually hear to reduce storage (**psychoacoustics**)

##### Differential Encoding
Sequence of values (such as an audio signal) is encoded by representing each value as the difference from the previous value
Lossy since the signal might jump so much between consecutive values that the difference does not fit in the field for expressing differences
This is an example of source encoding because large jumps between consecutive data points are unlikely.

Assume the following examples store differences in a **single digit**

| Raw Data           | 112 | 98               | 105                              | 110 |
| ------------------ | --- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- | --- |
| Compressed Data    | 112 | -9 (vs -14)      | 2 (based on reconstructed value) | 5   |
| Reconstructed Data | 112 | 103 (some error) | 105                              | 110 |
Or

| Raw Data           | 137 | 139 | 152              | 154 |
| ------------------ | --- | --- | ---------------- | --- |
| Compressed Data    | 137 | 2   | 9 (vs 13)        | 6   |
| Reconstructed Data | 137 | 139 | 148 (some error) | 154 |

##### Transformations - Signals
Signals are transformed from one domain to another to achieve compression
For example, consider a two-dimensional grayscale image of size 4x4 pixels

| 160 | 160 | 161 | 160 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 161 | 165 | 166 | 158 |
| 160 | 167 | 165 | 161 |
| 159 | 160 | 161 | 171 |
These data points can be transformed by subtracting the value in the upper left corner from all pixels but itself

| **160** (8-bit) | 0 (4-bit) | 1 (4-bit) | 0 (4-bit)                |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| 1               | 5         | 6         | -2                       |
| 0               | 7         | 5         | 1                        |
| -1              | 0         | 1         | -8, 11 (4 + 8 = 12 bits) |
This type of transformation would be especially useful if **variable length encoding** is used
- For example, differences from $-7$ to $+7$ could be encoded with 4-bit numbers
- Differences outside this range could be stored in 8 bits. The value of $-8$ would be used as a special marker to indicate that a 8-bit difference follows

##### Vector Quantization
Source encoding directly related to image data
In this case, the image is divided into rectangles.
In addition to the image itself, a table of rectangle is used (**Code Book**)
Each rectangle is transmitted by looking up in the code book and just sending the index into the table rather than the rectangle itself.
If a code book is created dynamically (per some set of images), then the code book is transmitted as well. If a small number of rectangles dominates hte image, a large compression factor can be achieved

Similar to the **Color lookup table**
Good for things like videos where the frame doesn't change that much
