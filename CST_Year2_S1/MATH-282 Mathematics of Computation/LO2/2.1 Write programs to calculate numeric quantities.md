*"Iterative" methods = repeated calculations*
## General algorithm for iterative method
Start with an *initial approximation*
While the approximation is not "*close enough*"
- *Find a better approximation*

Return the last approximation

For any specific iterative method, we just need to figure out the italisized parts
Also, such approximations only work if the approximations "converge" (Get closer to the exact answer)

## Exponential Function
Recall
$$
e = \frac {1} {0!} + \frac {1} {1!} + \frac {1} {2!} + ... = \sum ^{∞} _{k=0} \frac 1 {k!}
$$
This process can be extended to the exponential function, which is $e^x$ for some value x.
$$
e^x = 1 + \frac x {1!} + \frac {x^2} {2!} + \frac {x^3} {3!} \text{...}
$$
$$
\sum ^{∞} _{k=0} \frac {x^k} {k!}
$$
Initial approximation: 1
Better approximation: Add the next term for k, $\frac {x^k}  {k!}$
Close enough: Check the difference between successive calculations
We started by calculating $e^x$ using calculations for $x^k$ and $k!$
seperately, and then dividing them but note that each term is related to the previous term, such that the $\text{new term} = \text{old term} * x / k$
Also note that error new result - old result is just the value of the new term
Also it's better to use relative error rather than the amount of error so we can better handle really big or small numbers

## Sine Function
We can calculate the sine of an angle x in radians using the formula
$$
\sum ^{∞} _{k = 0} \frac {(-1)^k} {(2k + 1)!} x^{2k+1} = x - \frac {x^3} {3!} + \frac {x^5} {5!} - \frac {x^7} {7!} \text{...} = sin x
$$
Note that x is in Radians. What does that mean? Recall that a circle = 360 degrees. Another way to measure angles is to take the radius along the edge of a circle and see how many radiuses the angle would cut off along the circumference
![](Pasted%20image%2020240913090911.png)

Note that 360 degrees is the whole circle, and the radius goes around the circle $2*\pi$ times (since the circumference is $\pi * \text{diameter}$, and the diameter is $2 * \text{radius}$)
- $360 \text{degrees} = 2 * \pi \text{ radians}$
- $180 degrees = \pi \text{ radians}$
- $90 degrees = \pi / 2 \text{ radians}$
- In general $\text{angle degrees} = (\text{angle} * \pi / 180) \text{ radians}$

Going back to:
$$
\sum ^{∞} _{k = 0} \frac {(-1)^k} {(2k + 1)!} x^{2k+1} = x - \frac {x^3} {3!} + \frac {x^5} {5!} - \frac {x^7} {7!} \text{...} = sin x
$$
We can see that we have an initial approximation (x), we have a way of checking if we're close enough (check successive guesses)
We can improve our answer:
First, we can use the relationship between terms:
- Each term is $-1 * \text{ previous term } * x * x / (2k * (2k+1))$

## Finding Square Roots
Given x, we seek the sqrt(x) to some desired precision
We know that sqrt(x) is always between 1 and x. This gives us upper and lower boundaries. We can guess halfway between the upper/lower boundaries and compare $\text{guess}^2$ to x.
- if $\text{guess}^x = x$, then guess is the square root of x.
- If $\text{guess}^2 > x$, then the guess is too large and is the new upper boundary
- if $\text{guess}^2 < x$, the guess is too small and it's the new lower boundary

We can use the new boundaries to repeat this process until we're "close enough"
### *PARTIAL* algorithm for finding the square roots by bisection
Given x, precision 
```
guess <- 0
if x < 0
	indicate an error
if x > 0, lower <- 1, upper <- x
	lower <- 1
	upper <- x
	keepGoing <- true
	while keepgoing
		guess <- (lower + upper) / 2
		test <- guess * guess
		if test equals x
			keepgoing <- false
		else if test > x
			upper <- guess
		else
			lower <- guess
		if (upper - lower) <= precision
			keepgoing <- false
```

### Square Roots using Babylonian method
Given x, we seek $a = \text{sqrt(x)}$ to some desired precision
make an initial guess $a_o = 1$
$$
a_n = (a_{n-1} + \frac x {a_{n-1}}) / 2
$$
$\text{New guess} = 0.5 * (\text{oldGuess} + x / \text{oldGuess})$
Creates a new series of numbers
- $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$, ... -> a

#### Algorithm
Given x, precision
```
guess <- 0
if x < 0
	indicate error
else if x > 0
	guess <- 1
	keepGoing <- false
	while keepGoing
		oldGuess <- guess
		guess <- (old guess + x / oldGuess) / 2
		if |guess - oldGuess| <= precision
			keepGoing <- false
return guess
```

## Finding the zeros (or roots) of a function
*Function*: A rule that maps values of $x$  to values of $f(x)$
How can we express functions?
### Formula/equations
Ex. $f(x) = 2x + 1 \text{ or } y = 2x + 1$
$g(x) = sin(x)$
$h(x) = e^x - \sqrt x$
$p(x) = x^2 - 2$

### Table

| x    | $f(x) = 2x + 1$ |
| ---- | --------------- |
| -1   | -1              |
| -0.5 | 0               |
| 0    | 1               |
| 0.5  | 2               |
| 1    | 3               |

### On a graph
![](Pasted%20image%2020240920081829.png)

A "zero" or "root" of a function is a value of x where $f(x) = 0$
- NOTE: not $f(0)$, the values of the function where x = 0

We can find the zero of the function in many ways
- It might show up in the table of values
- Here, $x = -0.5$ is a zero of $f(x)$
- We can also find the zeros on a graph - a zero is where the function touches the x-axis
- In some cases, we can solve analytically (algebra)
	- $f(x) = 2x + 1$
	- $0 = 2x + 1$
	- $-1 = 2x$
	- $\frac {-1} 2 = x$
- We can also use computational methods for finding the zero of a function
	- In particular we will look at bisection
- Another function example
	- $f(x) = 3x^2 - x - 2$
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020240920082931.png)
	- this has two spots where the function = 0

#### Solving analytically with the quadratic equation
$$
x = \frac {-b ± \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac}} {2a}
$$
$$
x1 =\frac {1 + \sqrt {(-1^2) -4*3 * (-2)}} {2*3}
$$
*Missing $c$*
## Polynomial Functions
Made up of sums of powers of x
$$
p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \text {...} + a_nx^n
$$
$a_0$ is just $a_0x^0$ and $a_1x$ is just $a_ax^1$
### Examples
$$
f(x) = 2x + 1 = 1 + 2x
$$
*Degree 2 (Parabola)*
$$
f(x) = 3x^2 - x - 2
$$
*Degree 7 (Parabola)*
$$
p(x) = 9.5x^7 + 3x^5 - 2.1x^2 - 7
$$
*The degree of a polynomial function is it's highest power of x*
- Also determines the number of direction changes the graph has.
- Odd numbered degrees (3,5,7,etc.) always go to positive and negative y infinity.
- Even numbered degrees (0,2,4, etc.) never go to both negative and positive y infinity.
- There are *at most* d zeros if p(x) is of degree d

We can solve analytically for polynomials of degree 1, 2, 3, and 4 but there is no general solution for finding zeros of higher degrees

### Computational Approaches to finding zeros (Bisection)
Suppose we have $x_1$ where $f(x_1) > 0$ and $x_2$ where the value of $f(x_2) < 0$
Then if the function is *continuous* (Smoothly connected) in that range, $f(x)$ must have a zero between $x_1$ and $x_2$, since the function switches from positive to negative and must touch the x axis.
To find the zero, we can use bisection
- Guess halfway between $x_1 \text{ and } x_2$, so $\text{guess } =\frac  {(x_1 + x_2)} 2$
- Cacluate $f(\text{guess})$
- if $f(\text{guess}) = 0$, guess is a zero of the function
- If $f(\text{guess}) > 0$, guess is a new value for $x_1$
- if $f(\text{guess}) < 0$, guess is the new value for $x_2$
- repeat the process until we are "close enough" (Difference between $x_1$ and $x_2$ is small enough)
See `Quadratic Function.xlsx` and `Sample Function for zero-finding by bisection.xlsx` and `function examples.xlsx` in the **LO2** folder

### Algorithm for zero finding using bisection
```
Given f(x), xEvalPos, xEvalNeg, precision
keepGoing <- true
while keepGoing
	guess <- (xEvalPos + xEvalNeg)/ 2
	fAtGuess <- f(guess)
	if fAtGuess equals 0
		keepGoing <- false
	else if fAtGuess > 0
		xEvalPos <- guess
	else
		xEvalNeg <- guess
	error <- |xEvalPos - xEvalNeg|
	if error <= precision
		keepGoing <- false

return guess
```
Also see *`Algorithm for Finding Zeros Using Bisection.docx`* in the LO2 Directory for more details
To code in Java, se need Classes to represent each function and a way to store common code for each function
See the starting cod in the `Function` folder
- `IFunction.java` - Interface or "contract" for what the function must implement - add the definition of the `findZero` method to it
- `ACFunction.java` - Abstract class for what all functions can do. Where we will implement the `findZero` method using `this.calculate()` to get function values
- `Function1.java` and `Function2.java` - extend the abstract class to implement a specific `calculate()` method
- `TestFunction.java` - creates function objects, calls `printTable` and `findZero` methods to find zeros.

we can add new functions like $f(x) = e^x - cos x - 1$ by adding new function classes that extend `ACFunction`
- Note that Bisection only works if we have both positive and negative values. If it jus touches the x axis, we can't find such starting values.
- The function must also be continuous between the starting values
- finally, we can only find one zero between the starting points - if the function goes up and down and up and down, we won't find the other zero.
