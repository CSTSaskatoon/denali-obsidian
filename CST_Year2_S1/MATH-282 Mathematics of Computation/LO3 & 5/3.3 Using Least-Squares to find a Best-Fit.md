# Least-Squares
Suppose we are given a set of $(x,y)$ points and we want to find the polynomial equation that best fits those points.
Recall that the general form for a polynomial equation is
$$
y = a_m x^m + a_{m - 1} x^{m - 1} + ... + a_xx^2 + a_1x + a_0
$$

$m$ must non-negative and is called the *degree* of the equation.

$$
y = 2x^2 + 3x + 1 \text { (degree 2, coefficients are 2, 3 and 1)}
$$
$$
y = -3x^3 -1 \text{ (degree 3, coefficients are -3, 0, 0 and -1)}
$$

To find a desired polynomial equation, we need to find the coefficients for that equation ($a_m, ..., a_2, a_1, a_0$)
So given a set of $(x,y)$ points, and a desired degree $m$, we would like to find the coefficients of degree $m$

To find the coefficients, we can build a system of linear equations that can be solved using the formula below
$$
a_0 N + a_1 \sum x + a_2 \sum x^2 + ... + a_m \sum x^m = \sum y
$$
$$
a_0 \sum x + a_1 \sum x^2 + a_2 \sum x^3 + ... + a_m \sum x^{m+1} = \sum xy
$$
$$
a_0 \sum x^m + a_1 \sum x^{m+1} + a_2 \sum x^{m+2} + ... + a_m \sum x^{2m} = \sum x^my
$$
Where
- $m$ is the degree of the polynomial that we want to find
- $a_i$ are the coefficients of the least-squares equation (*The values we wish to seek*)
- $N$ is the number of data points
- $x$ and $y$ are the data points (could be represented as $x_i$ $y_i$ for $i = 1 \text{ to } N$)

Note that the pattern of the equations - *with a degree of $m$, our last equation will start with the sum of the $x$ values to the $m^{th}$ power and goes to the sum of the $x$ values to the $m^{th}$ power $*$ the $y$ values.*

| $x$ | $y$  | $x^2$ | $x^3$ | $x^4$ | $xy$ | $x^2y$ |
| --- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ------ |
| -1  | 4    | 1     | -1    | 1     | -4   | 4      |
| 0   | 2    | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0    | 0      |
| 1   | 1    | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1    | 1      |
| 2   | 2    | 4     | 8     | 16    | 4    | 8      |
| 3   | 4    | 9     | 27    | 81    | 12   | 36     |
| *5* | *13* | *15*  | *35*  | *99*  | *13* | *49*   |

$N = 5 \text { data points}$ (Can be considered an x-sum since it is the sum of the x values to the $0^{th}$ power)
Degree $m = 2$
Have $m + 1 = 3$ unknowns ($a_0, a_1, a_2$)
We have $m + 1 = 3$ equations
We have $2m + 1 = 5$ x-sums (Includes $N$)
We have $m + 1 = 3$ y-sums
Here are the equations:
$$
a_0 N + a_1 \sum x + a_2 \sum x^2 = \sum y
$$
$$
a_0 \sum x + a_1 \sum x^2 + a_2 \sum x^3 = \sum xy
$$
$$
a_0 \sum x^2 + a_1 \sum x^3 + a_2 \sum x^4 = \sum x^2y
$$

### Example 1
$$
a_05 + a_15 + a_115= 13
$$
$$
a_05 + a_115 + a_235 = 13
$$
$$
a_015 + a_135 + a_299 = 49
$$

We can solve for the values of $a_0$, $a_1$ and $a_2$ using *Gauss-Jordan* elimination
#### Row 1

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 5 & 15 & 13 \\ 5 & 15 & 35 & 13 \\ 15 & 35 & 99 & 49 \end{bmatrix}
-> \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 3 & 2.6 \\ 0 & 10 & 20 & 0 \\ 0 & 20 & 54 & 10 \end{bmatrix}
$$
1. Divide *R1* by *5*
2. *R2* = *R2* - *5* * new *R1*
3. *R3* = *R3* - *15* * new *R1*

#### Row 2
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 3 & 2.6 \\ 0 & 10 & 20 & 0 \\ 0 & 20 & 54 & 10 \end{bmatrix}
-> \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 2.6 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 14 & 10 \end{bmatrix}
$$
1. Divide *R2* by *10*
2. *R1* = *R1* - *1* * new *R2*
3. *R3* = *R3* - *20* * new *R2*

#### Row 3
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 2.6 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 14 & 10 \end{bmatrix}
-> \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1.8857 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -1.4286 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0.7143 \end{bmatrix}
$$
1. Divide *R3* by *14*
2. *R1* = *R1* - *1* * new *R3*
3. *R2* = *R2* - *2* * new *R3*

#### Solution
So thus, $a_0 = 1.8857$, $a_1 = -1.4286$ and $a_2 = 0.7143$
Final result is
$$
y = 1.8857 - 1.4286x + 0.7143x^2
$$
OR
$$
y = 0.7143x^2 -1.4286x + 1.8857
$$
We can now plug values of $x$ into this equation to get predicted values of $y$. For instance, for $x = 0.5$, we would predict that $y = 0.7143(0.25) - 1.4286(0.5) + 1.8857 = 1.35$ approximately

### Summary of the relationships
we are given $m$, the desired degree of the least-squares equation
The number of *unknowns* = $m + 1$
The number of *equations* = the number of unknowns = $m + 1$
The number of *x-sums* (including $N$) = $2m + 1$
The number of *y-sums* = $m + 1$

### Example 2
| x   | y    | xy  | $x^2$ | $y^2$ | $x^3$ | $x^4$ | $x^2y$ |
| --- | ---- | --- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| -2  | 2    | -4  | 4     | 4     | -8    | 16    | 8      |
| -1  | 1    | -1  | 1     | 1     | -1    | 1     | 1      |
| 0   | 3    | 0   | 0     | 9     | 0     | 0     | 0      |
| 1   | 4    | 4   | 1     | 16    | 1     | 1     | 4      |
| 2   | 5    | 10  | 4     | 25    | 8     | 16    | 20     |
| *0* | *15* | *9* | *10*  | *55*  | *0*   | *34*  | *33*   |
Suppose we want to find an equation of degree 1 that fits those points
$m = 1$
$N = 5$
*unknowns* = $2$
*equations* = $2$
*x-sums* = $3$
*y-sums* = $2$

#### Equations
$$
a_0 5 + a_1 0 = 15
$$
$$
a_0 0 + a_1 10 = 9
$$

#### Augmented matrix
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 0 & 15 \\ 0 & 10 & 9 \end{bmatrix}
-> \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 3 \\ 0 & 10 & 9 \end{bmatrix}
-> \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & 0.9 \end{bmatrix}
$$

#### Solution
Thus, $a_0 = 3$ and $a_1 = 0.9$ and our equation is $y = 3 + 0.9x$ or $y = 0.9x + 3$

#### Degree 2 Solution
What would we change to make it degree 2?
$m = 2$ instead of $1$
unknowns = 3
equations = 3
x-sums = 5
y-sums = 3
N = 5

#### Equations
*Skip ahead*

#### Augmented Matrix
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 0 & 10 & 15 \\ 0 & 10 & 0 & 9 \\ 10 & 0 & 34 & 33 \end{bmatrix}
$$

### Summary
We want a polynomial equation of degree $m$ that best fits a number of data points
We must determine the coefficients $a_0$ to $a_m$ of the equation
To do so, we use the formulas (Will be given on the final) given to us by the magic of math which require $2m + 1$ x-sums and $m + 1$ y-sums to create a system of equations which can be solved by Gauss-Jordan Elimination

*Additional Notes*
- The number of data points must be at least 1 more than the degree (N > m) or else we don't have enough points
- The augmented matrix will always be the size $m + 1$ rows by $m + 2$ columns
- $\sum x^2 \text{ is not } (\sum x)^2$ since the $x^2$ has precedence

## Coding for Least Squares
First, add test code from `TestMatrix.java` in *`LO3/Matrix3`*
Then we have to add code to `IMatrix.java` for the `least-squares` method
Finally, we can implement the solution for solving least-squares

Actual implementation of the code is left to us
- Find x-sums first and then printing them off or checking in debugger to verify they are the same results we got in class
- test code examples from `2021a Least-SquaresExamples.xlsx`
- Do the same for y-sums
- plug the values into the augmented matrix
	- y-sums are straightforward, just values at the end of each row
	- x-sums look at `Positions of x-sums and y-sums.xlsx` in the *LO3* folder for the pattern to follow
