## Gauss-Jordan Elimination
Recall that we solve two equations for $x$ and $y$ - for example
$$
5x - 2y = 7
$$
$$
3x + 5y = 29
$$
There are several ways to solve this, including
*Substitution* - $5x = 7 - 2y$, then $x = 7/5 - 2/5y$, and substitution for $x$ in the second equation to get an equation that's only in $y$, solve it for y, and then determine $x$ using the formula.
*Add/Subtract Equations* - $8x + 3y = 36$ (Doesn't help us in this case)

### Result of solving the two equations
One point (one $x$ value and one $y$ value) if the two lines intersect
*No solution if the lines are parallel*
Infinite solutions if both equations represent the same line.

### Solving for more variables
Need more equations (three equations in 3 variables, or four equations in 4 variables), but the process can be complicated
Want a *uniform process* that will always work for *any number of variables/equations*

Note that we can represent equations with matrices - $\text {coefficient matrix } * \text { unkown vector } = \text { known vector}$
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 5 & -2 \\ 3 & 5 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ 29 \end{bmatrix}
$$
Multiply them out to see that you get the same equations:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 5x - 2y \\ 3x + 5y \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ 29 \end{bmatrix}
$$
Using matrices the goal is to transform the **coefficient matrix** into the **identity matrix**
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} ? \\ ? \end{bmatrix}
$$
Note that the identity matrix is like the value 1 in multiplication, where $1x = 7$ means that $x = 7$, so if we multiply by the identity matrix, we get the solution
The matrices are generally written as a single augmented matrix:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 5 & -2 & |7 \\ 3 & 5 &| 29 \end{bmatrix}
$$
(`|`  not required)
Our goal is then to get to the identity matrix with the solved values:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 5 & -2 & |? \\ 3 & 5 &| ? \end{bmatrix}
$$
There are 3 row operations that can be used to transform the coefficient matrix into the identity matrix:
1. Any row can be multiplied/divided by a non-zero constant
2. Any row can be multiplied/divided by a non-zero constant and added to another row
3. Any two rows can be swapped

#### So we can do the following (Example 1)
Divide the row by the element on the diagonal (pivot element) to get that position to 1
Take the negative of the value in the pivot column in the remaining rows and multiply the pivot row by it and add to the current row

##### Row 1
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 5 & -2 & 7 \\ 3 & 5 & 29 \end{bmatrix} ->
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -0.4 & 1.4 \\ 0 & 6.2 & 24.8 \end{bmatrix}
$$
*Divide row 1 by 5*
*Add -3 * new row 1 to row 2*

##### Row 2
$$
-> \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix}
$$
*Add 0.4 * new row 2 to row 1*
*Divide row 2 by 6.2*

##### Solution
So our answer is $x = 3$ and $y = 4$
We can verify our answers by plugging in these values into the original equations
$$
5(3) - 2(4) = 15 - 8 = 7
$$
$$
3(3) + 5(4) = 9 + 20 = 29
$$
You can also verify by doing matrix multiplication

#### 3 Equations, 3 Unknowns (Example 2)
$$
2x + 4y + 6z = 46
$$
$$
3x + 12y + 12z = 102
$$
$$
4x + 5y + z = 28
$$
Written as the $\text{coefficient matrix } * \text{ unknown vector } = \text{ known vector}$
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 6 \\ 3 & 12 & 12 \\ 4 & 5 & 1 \end{bmatrix} *
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 46 \\ 102 \\ 28 \end{bmatrix}
$$
Can be written as augmented matrix (which we can transform)

##### Row 1
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 6 & 46 \\ 3 & 12 & 12 & 102 \\ 4 & 5 & 1 & 28 \end{bmatrix} ==>
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 23 \\ 0 & 6 & 3 & 33 \\ 0 & -3 & -11 & -64 \end{bmatrix}
$$
*Divide R1 by 2*
*R2 = R2 - 3 * new R1*
*R3 - R3 - 4 * new R1*

##### Row 2
$$
==> \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 2 & 12 \\ 0 & 1 & 0.5 & 5.5 \\ 0 & 0 & -9.5 & -47.5 \end{bmatrix}
$$
*R1 = R1 - 2 * new R2*
*Divide R2 by 6*
*R3 = R3 + 3 * new R2*

##### Row 3
$$
==> \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 5 \end{bmatrix}
$$
*R1 = R1 -2 * new R3*
*R2 = R2 - 0.5 * new R3*
*Divide R3 by -9.5*

##### Solution
So our answers are $x = 2$, $y = 3$, and $z = 5$
**Verification**
$$
2x + 4y + 6z = 2(2) + 4(3) + 6(5) = 4 + 12 + 30 = 46
$$
$$
3x + 12y + 12z = 3(2) + 12(3) + 12(5) = 6 + 36 + 60 = 102
$$
$$
4x + 5y + z = 4(2) + 5(3) + 5 = 8 + 15 + 5 = 28
$$

### General Solution Strategy
*Ignore unsolvable equations for now*

For each row in the matrix
- Reduce the pivot element to 1 (Pivot is the element on the diagonal)
- Use the pivot element to convert elements in the corresponding column to 0

#### Algorithm
```
for each row in augmented matrix
	pivot <- get pivot for current row // pivot is on the diagonal
	for each element in the current pivot row
		current element <- current element / pivot
	For each row in the matrix
		if the current row is not the pivot row
			dFactor <- -1 * corresponding element to the pivot in the current row
			For each column in the current row
				current element <- current element + dFactor * corresponding element in pivot
```

#### System Solvable (Getting pivot)
```
pivot <- get pivot element for current row
while pivot is 0
	check the rows below the pivot for a non-zero point
	if a non-zero pivot is found
		swap pivot row with the non-zero row
	else
		indicate there is no solution
return pivot
```

### Common errors in doing Gauss-Jordan elimination
Getting the coefficients wrong
- remember that subtraction means negative coefficients and missing terms mean 0 coefficients
- Ex. $3x -z = 0$ is $3x + 0y -1z = 0$

Not following the process
- Make sure you don't add a number to each term
- Ex. adding 2 to every term would be adding $2x + 2y + 2z = 2$, which is not valid unless that's another equation

Forgetting to use the new pivot row 
- Write out each step separately (divide the pivot row, then in the next step convert pivot row to 0)

Not writing out the steps followed (Should write *Divide R1 by 2* or *R2 = R2 + 7 * new R1*)

Not rewriting answers in terms of x, y and z

Not verifying the answers for all equations
- On the final don't spend too much time verifying cause if you've followed the process but make a small math error you still get most of the marks

### Practice
#### Example 1
$2x + 3y = 7$
$-7x - 3y = 10$

**Augmented Matrix**
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 & 7 \\ -7 & -3 & 10 \end{bmatrix}
$$
##### Row 1
$$
==> \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1.5 & 3.5 \\ 0 & 7.5 & 34.5 \end{bmatrix}
$$
*`Pivot` is 2, divide R1 by 2*
*`dFactor` is 7, add 7 * new R1 to R2*

##### Row 2
$$
==> \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -3.4 \\ 0 & 1 & 4.6 \end{bmatrix}
$$
*`Pivot` is 7.5, divide R2 by 7.5*
*`dFactor` is -1.5, add -1.5 * new R2 to R1*

##### Solution
Answer is $x = -3.4$ and $y = 4.6$

**Verification**
$2x + 3y = 2(-3.4) + 3(4.6) = -6.8 + 13.8 = 7$
$-7x -3y = -7(-3.4) + -3(4.6) = 23.8 - 13.8 = 10$

#### Example 2
$x + y + 2z = 8$
$-1x - 2y + 3z = 1$
$3x - 7y + 4z = 10$

**Augmented Matrix**
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 & 8 \\ -1 & -2 & 3 & 1 \\ 3 & -7 & 4 & 10 \end{bmatrix}
$$

##### Row 1
$$
==> \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 & 8 \\ 0 & -1 & 5 & 9 \\ 0 & -10 & -2 & -14 \end{bmatrix}
$$

*`pivot` is 1, divide R1 by 1*
*R2 = R2 + 1 * new R1*
*R3 = R3 - 3 * new R1*

##### Row 2
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 7 & 17 \\ 0 & 1 & -5 & -9 \\ 0 & 0 & -52 & -104 \end{bmatrix}
$$

*`pivot` is -1, divide R2 by -1*
*R1 = R1 - 1 * new R2*
*R3 = R3 + 10 * new R2*

##### Row 3
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}
$$

*R3 = R3 / -52*
*R1 = R1 -7 * new R3
*R2 = R2 + 5 * new R3*

##### Solution
$x = 3$, $y = 1$, and $z = 3$

**Verification**
$3 + 1 + 2(2) = 3 + 1 + 4 = 8$
$-1(3)$


#### Example 3
$2x + 2y + 4z = 12$
$2y + z = 4$
$2x + y + z = 7$

#### Example 4
**UNSOLVABLE because one of the pivots ends up as 0**
$3x + 2y + 7z = 123$
$6x + 4y + z = 98$
$-3x - 2y + 8z = 10$

*Additional practices can be found in the `GaussJordanElimination` folder in the `LO3` folder on the Math282 OneDrive*

#### Row Swap Example
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4 & 4 & -20 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 & -30 \\ 2 & 4 & 4 & 0 \end{bmatrix} -> \text {(swap R1 with R3)}
\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 4 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 & -30 \\ 0 & 4 & 4 & -20 \end{bmatrix} -> 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 & -30 \\ 0 & 4 & 4 & -20 \end{bmatrix} -> \text {(swap R2 with R3)}
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 & 4 & -20 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 & -30 \end{bmatrix} -> 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 10 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & -5 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 & -30 \end{bmatrix} -> 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 10 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -10 \end{bmatrix}
$$

##### Solution
$x = 10$, $y = 5$, $z = -10$
$0(10) + 4(5) + 4(-10) = 0 + 20 -40 = -20$
$0(10) + 0(5) + 3(-10) = 0 + 0 + -30 = -30$
$2(10) + 4(5) + 4(-10) = 20 + 20 - 40 = 0$

### Coding the Gauss-Jordan Elimination
First we should add some test code - see `TestMatrix.java` in `LO3/matrix3`

Next, we must add code to `IMatrix` for the `gaussJordanElimination()`

Then, we must add the correct code to `ACMatrix` to actually solve the system of linear equations

Test this code to verify it works with a variety of possible situations (4x5 matrix, 2x3 matrix, solution that requires swapping, no solution, etc.)
Note that because of representation/roundoff errors, results may be slightly off

In the test code provided, there are two interesting cases at the bottom. The two matrices solves are very similar at the start
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 1.001 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \text{ and }
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 1.001 & 2.001 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Yet the solutions are quite different

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \text{ and }
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

such matrices where a small change in the starting values can result in a large change in the results are called **ill-conditioned**.
- Are a problem because we don't always have exact starting values
