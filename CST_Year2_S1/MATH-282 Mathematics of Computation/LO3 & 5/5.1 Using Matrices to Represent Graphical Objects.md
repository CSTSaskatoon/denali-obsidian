## 2-Dimensional
Can be represented as a set of data points, which can be stored in an $n * 2$ matrix (for now) where $n$ is the number of data points

### Transformations
1. Scaling - make the object bigger or smaller
2. Translation - move the object
3. Rotation - rotate the object around some point

#### Scaling
To scale the object by some factors $S_x$ and $S_y$
- $x' = x * S_x$
- $y' = y * S_y$
- *A side affect of scaling is to move the object*

>$x'$ is "x prime" (changed value of x)
>Can use $x''$, $x'''$, etc. if x is changed more than once (Ex. translate and then rotate)

#### Translation
To translate the object by some amount $T_x$ and $T_y$
- $x' = x + T_x$
- $y' = y + T_y$
- *No side affects*

#### Rotation
To rotate clockwise by some angle $\theta$ (in radians - recall that $\text{radians } = \text{degrees } * \frac {\pi} {180}$)
- $x' = x * \cos \theta + y * \sin \theta$
- $y' = -x * \sin \theta + y * \cos \theta$
- *A side affect of rotation is to move the object*

See **`Transformations B.xlsx`** in the LO5 folder for examples of 3 transformations and their side effects

### Dealing with Side effects
We saw that scaling and rotation also moved the object. Rotation or scaling is done around the *world origin* (0, 0).
We need to pick a *local origin* to rotate/scale around.
1. Translate the local origin to the world origin (Ex. $T_x = -2$ and $T_y = -2$ for a local origin of $(2,2)$)
2. Perform rotation
3. Translate the world origin back to the origin (Ex. $T_x = 2$ and $T_y = 2$ if the local origin was $(2,2)$)

*Local origin can be anywhere, even outside the object*
See **`RotationAroundLocalOrigin`** worksheet in `Transformations B.xlsx` in the LO5 folder
