Keep in mind that calculations with operators can introduce problems with *underflow* and *overflow*, but also with precision even if we are starting with exact values

### How do we deal with errors in real numbers?
We can round off (controlled error)
We can introduce more digits (still limited by the representation)
Switch from binary to decimal (For instance the `BigDecimal` class in Java) - can introduce performance issues

#### Example
*Something like this might be on the midterm. WE ARE ALLOWED CALCULATORS AND THE WINDOWS CALCULATOR ON EXAMS*

Suppose you are working with a decimal matching (rather than binary) that stores numbers in the form ±#.### * 10^## Assume calculations can be done with exact precision, but results of the calculation must be rounded off to be stored as shown above after every calculation step
- Largest possible is *9.999 * 10^99*
- Smallest possible number is *0.001 * 10^-99* (Or *1.000 * 10^-99*)
- 5387 would be represented as *5.387 * 10^03* (stored as 538703) No Error
- 1.236 would be represented as *1.236 * 10^00* No error
- $-0.012343 = -1.234 * 10^{(-2)}$ (Precision error because we rounded off the 3)
- $5387 + 1.236 = 5388.236 = 5.388 * 10^3$ (Error introduced because we had to round off 3 numbers after adding them together)
- $5387 * 1.236 = 6658.332 = 6.658 * 10^3$ (Error introduced because we had to round off 3 numbers after multiplying them together)

#### Types of error in computation
1. Representation error (Due to limited precision)
2. Measurement error (from humans/equipment/skill issue)
3. Round-off error (from computer representation, measurement, or calculations) - can sometimes be quantified - Ex. 42 +- 0.5kg
4. Truncation error - for formulas with many/infinite terms, we only add some of them
	1. Ex.  $e = 1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + ... = E * 1/(n!)$

```Java
System.out.println("\nCalculating e:");
double euler = 0.0;
for (int n = 0; n < 30; n++)
{
	euler += 1.0 / dFact(n);
	System.out.println(euler + " after term: " + n + " with truncation error " + (Math.E - euler))
}
```
After looping around 17 times, the value it prints out and the truncation error stop changing because the difference is so small.

```Java
// Euler Reverse
double eulerReverse = 0.0;
for(int n = 20; n >= 0; n--) 
{
	eulerReverse += 1.0 / dFact(n);
}
System.out.println(eulerReverse);
System.out.println(Math.E - eulerReverse);
```
This one has a smaller amount of truncation, order of operations matter

Example - Suppose we are working with the machine described earlier
- $3877 = 3.877 * 10^3$
- $1.2 = 1.200 * 10^0$
- $0.4 = 4.000 * 10^-1$
- $0.3 = 3.000 * 10^-1$

Added up in order
- $3877 + 1.2 = 3878.2$ represented as $3.878 * 10^3 = 3878$ (Roundoff error)
- $3878 + 0.4 = 3878.4$ represented as $3.878 * 10^3 = 3878$ (Roundoff error)
- $3878 + 0.3 = 3878.3$ represented as $3.878 * 10^3 = 3878$ (Roundoff error)

Added up in reverse order
- $0.3 + 0.4 = 0.7$ represented as $7.000 * 10^-1$ (no error)
- $0.7 + 1.2 = 1.9$ represented as $1.900 * 10^0$ (No error)
- $1.9 + 3878 = 3878.9$ represented as $3.879 * 10^3$ (Roundoff error)

Correct answer (mathematically) would be **3878.9**
So it's **NOT** true for this computer that $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
##### So why don't we need to worry about this?
Usually we don't need complete precision
We can usually get more precision
Roundoff errors may cancel
Example poll results
- 10 say bowl 10/30 = 33% (roundoff error)
- 20 say cone 20/30 = 67% (roundoff error)
- **30 total  33% + 67% = 100% (No error, same as 30/30)**

##### So why should we worry?
Awareness - for instance, don't expect doubles to be exactly equal; for reporting - for instance, 17 degrees C = 62.6 degreees F, but 17 probably wasn't an exact value so report it as 63 degrees F.
Extra precision can be performance-intensive
Roundoff errors can accumulate
Example poll results
- 10 say chocolate 10/30 = 33% (some error)
- 10 say strawberry 10/30 = 33% (some error)
- 10 say vanilla 10/30 = 33% (some error)
- **30 total 33% + 33% + 33% = 99% (error has grown)**

### Calculating errors in Computation
Suppose we have
- Exact value x
- Approximated by $x_{a}$
- With error E

Then
- Exact = approximate + error or $x = x^{a} + E_{x}$
- Error = exact - approximate, or $E = x - x$ (May be positive or negative)
- Size of the error is absolute, | E | (removes negative sign)
- Relative error = error / exact = E / x = 

##### Example 1
Suppose $x = 15.2$ and $x_a = 15$; then $E_x$ = 15.2 - 15 = 0.2
- Absolute error $|E_x|$ would be 0.2 as well
- Relative error would be $0.2/15.2 = 0.013$ or **1.3%**

Suppose $y = 399.8$ and $y_a = 400$; then $E_y = 399.8 - 400 = -0.2$
- Absolute error $|E_y|$ would be $|-0.2| = 0.2$
- The relative error would be $-0.2 / 399.8 = -0.0005$ or **-0.05%**

##### Example 2
Suppose $x = 123 ±0.5$; then $x_a = 123$ and $E_x = ±0.5$ (At maximum)
- Absolute (maximum) error would be 0.5
- Relative error would be $±0.5 / 123 = ±0.004$ or $±0.4$% (max)

#### Addition
Suppose we have $x = x_a + E_x$ and $y = y_a + E_y$
- $x + y = (x_a + E_x) + (y_a + E_y)$
- $x_a + y_a + E_x + E_y$
- Exact = approximate + error
- $E_{x+y} = E_x + E_y$
- Relative error = error/exact = $(E_x + E_y) / (x + y)$
- Assume x and y are positive. The bottom part of the equation $x + y$ will grow. Because of that, the relative error will be somewhat stable

Note that errors may be positive or negative, so errors may grow or cancel.

##### Example 1
Suppose $x = 204$ and $x_a = 200$ so $E_x = 4$ and rel. error = $0.0196 = 1.96$%
Suppose $y = 123$ and $y_a = 120$ so $E_y = 3$ and rel. error = $0.0244 = 2.44$%
Then $x + y = 327$ (exactly), but the best approximation would be $x_a + y_a = 200 + 120 = 320$
Error would be $E_{x+y} = E_x + E_y = 4 + 3 = 7$ (Or $327 - 320 = 7$)
Relative error = error / exact = $7 / 327 = 0.0214 = 2.14$% (which is between the relative errors in x and y)

##### Example 2
Suppose $x = 200 ±10$
$x_a = 200$, $E_x = ±10$ (At max), rel. error = $±10 / 200 = ±0.05 = ±5$%
Suppose $y = 160 ±4$
$y_a = 160$, $E_y = ±4$ (at max), rel. error = $±4 / 160 = ±0.025 = ±2.5$%
Then $x + y = y_a = 200 + 160 = 360$
Error would be $E_{x+y} = E_x + E_y = (±10) + (±4) = ±14$ (At max)
Rel. error = error/exact = $±14 / 360 = 0.389 ±3.89$% (Which is between 2.5% and 5%)

>Note that this can also be expressed as follows
>$x = 200 ±10 = 190...210$ as a range of values
>$y = 160 ±4 = 156...164$ as a range of values
>$x + y = 346...374$ which is $360 ±14$

#### Subtraction
Suppose we have $x = x_a + E_x$ and $y = y_a + E_a$ (With x and y positive)
$x - y = (x_a + E_x) - (y_a + E_y) = x_a - y_a +E_x - E_y$
Exact = approximate + error
$E_{x-y} = E_x - E_y$ (But recall each error may be positive or negative so the error may grow)
Relative error = $(E_x - E_y) / (x - y)$
Value on top may grow, but the value on the bottom will be less than at least one of x or y, so the relative error in subtraction may grow quickly.

##### Excel Example

| Variable | Exact | Approx | Error | Relative |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | -------- |
| x        | 103   | 100    | 3     | 2.9%     |
| y        | 62    | 60     | 2     | 3.2%     |
| x - y    | 41    | 40     | 1     | **2.4%** |
Error decreases

##### Excel Example 2
| Variable | Exact | Approx | Error | Relative |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | -------- |
| x        | 103   | 100    | 3     | 2.9%     |
| y        | 58    | 60     | -2    | -3.4%    |
| x - y    | 45    | 40     | 5     | **11%**  |
In this example the error grows quickly

##### Example 3
Suppose $x = 200 ±10$
$x_a = 200$, $E = ± 10$ (at max), rel. error = $±10 / 200 = ±0.05 = ±5$%
Suppose $y = 160 ± 4$
$y_a = 160$, $E_y = ±4$ (at max), rel. error = $±4 / 160 = ±0.025 = ±2.5$%
$x - y = 200 - 160 = 40$
$E_{x-y} = E_x - E_y = (±10) - (±4)$ = (**~~±6 WRONG~~**) = $±14$ (At max)
Rel. error = error / exact = $±14 / 40 = ± 0.35 = ±35$%

OR 
$x = 200 ±10 = 190...210$ but could be $190...210 (Small -> Large)
$y = 160 ± 4 = 156...164$ but could be $164...156$ (Large -> Small)
$x + y = 34...46$ **WRONG** so at max $26...54 = 40 ± 14$

#### Multiplication
Suppose we have $x = x_a + E_x$ and $y = y_a + E_y$
Then $xy = (x_a + E_x) * (y_a + E_y)$, Multiplication of terms distributed using FOIL (First/outside/inside/last)
$x_ay_a + x_aE_y + y_aE_x + E_xE_y$
Exact = approximate + error
So $E_{xy} = x_aE_y + y_aE_x + E_xE_y$
Rel. error = error/exact = $(x_aE_y + y_aE_x + E_xE_y) / xy$

![](Pasted%20image%2020240906094644.png)

Rel. error = $\frac {x_aE_y + x_yE_x +E_xE_y} {xy} ≈ \frac {x_aE_y + y_aE_x} {x_ay_a} = \frac {x_aE_y}{x_ay_a} + \frac {y_aE_x} {x_ay_a} = \frac {E_y} {y_a} + \frac {E_x} {x_a}$ 
≈ rel. error in y + rel. error in x
So relative error may grow in a stable fasion

##### Excel Example 1

|     | Exact | Approx | Error | Relative |
| --- | ----- | ------ | ----- | -------- |
| x   | 103   | 100    | 3     | 2.9%     |
| y   | 62    | 60     | 2     | 3.2%     |
| xy  | 6386  | 6000   | 386   | 6.0%     |
|     |       |        | 386   | 6.1%     |

Didn't get example 2

##### Example 3
suppose $x = 200 ± 10$
$x_a = 200$, $E_x = ± 10$ (At max), rel. error = $±10/200 = ±5\%$
suppose $y = 100 ± 4$
$y_a = 100$, $E_y = ±4$ (At max), rel. error = $±4/160 = ±2.5\%$
$xy = 200 * 160 = 32,000$
$E_{xy} = x_aE_y + y_aE_x + E_xE_y = 200*(±4) + 160*(±10) + (±4)*(±10) = (±800) + (±1600) + (±40) = ±2440$
Relative error = error / exact ≈ error / approx = $±2440 / 32000 = ±0.07652 = ±7.6\%$
Or relative error ≈ rel. error in x + rel. error in y = $(±5\%) + ±(2.5\%) = ±7.5\%$
Or $x = 200 ± 10 190...210$
$y = 160 ± 4 156...164$
$xy = 29,640...34,440$ or roughly $32,000 ± 2440$

#### Division
We aren't going through division examples because it's very similar to mulitplication
