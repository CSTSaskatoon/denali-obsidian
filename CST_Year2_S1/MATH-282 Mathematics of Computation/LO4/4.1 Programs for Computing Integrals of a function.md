# Integrals
We are sometimes interested in the area under the curve of a function (for instance, distance under a speed function). This is called the Integral
![](Pasted%20image%2020240927080349.png)
To estimate the area, we can **Break it up into a bunch of tiny rectangles**
Adding up their area, we get $\text{Estimate of area } = \sum f(x) \Delta x$
- where $\Delta x = x_2 - x_1$ is the width of the rectangle

Smaller rectangles give us better results. An "infinite" number of infinitely small rectangles will give us the exact answer - the integral. The notation for that is
- $\text {area } = \int f(x) dx$

This can be solved mathematically for some functions but not all.
For other functions, a computational approach is needed.

For our speed function $f(x) = \frac 1 4 x$, by the magic of calculus
$\int f(x) dx = \int (\frac 1 4 x) dx = \frac 1 8 x^2 = F(x)$
This is an **Indefinite Integral** because it doesn't go between any two specific values
For the distance traveled between minutes 0 to 8, we have a **Definite Integral**
- $\int ^8 _0 f(x)dx = \int ^8 _0 (\frac 1 4 x) dx = F(8) - F(0) = \frac 1 8 (8)^2 - \frac 1 8 (0)^2 = 8$
- $\int ^8 _6 f(x)dx = \int ^8 _6 (\frac 1 4 x) dx = F(8) - F(6) = \frac 1 8 (8)^2 - \frac 1 8 (6)^2 = 3.5$

See *`IntegrationBackground MATH282-CST.docx`* in the LO4 Folder for More info
We are interested in a computational approach that will take the area, divide it into smaller pieces and add up the are of the smaller pieces

## **Left** Rectangle Rule
1. Take the interval being integrated and divide it into equal parts
	1. For $\int ^9 _3 (\frac 1 3 x^2 - \frac 1 {300} x^4) dx$
		1. For 1 part, it would go from 3 to 9 for a width of 6
		2. For 2 parts, it would go from 3 to 6 and 6 to 9 for a width of 3
		3. For 4 parts, it would go from 3 to 4.5 and 4.5 to 6, 6 to 7.5, 7.5 to 9
		4. and so on...
2. For each part, create a rectangle with the height based on the value of f(x) at the **left** edge
	1. For 1 part, use a height of f(3)
	2. For 2 parts, use heights of f(3) and f(6)
	3. For 4 parts, use heights of f(3), f(4.5), f(6), f(7.5)
	4. And so on...
3. Add up the are of the parts
4. As long as estimate isn't "close enough", use more (twice as many) rectangles.

### Straightforward but inefficient algorithm
```
Given f(x), left, right, precision, maxLoops
rumRectangles <- 1
totalWidth <- right - left
height <- f(left)
estimate <- height * totalWidth

numLoops <- 0
keepGoing <- true

while (keepGoing)
	add 1 to numLoops
	oldEstimate <- estimate

	Multiply rumRectangles by 2
	currentWidth <- totalWidth / numRectangles
	estimate <- 0

	for each rectangle i starting at i = 0
		currentLeft <- left + i * currentWidth
		currentHeight <- f(currentLeft)
		currentArea <- currentHeight * currentWidth
		Add currentArea to estimate

	error <- | estimate - oldEstimate |
	relError <- | error / estimate |
	if relError <= precision
		keepGoing <- false
	else if numLoops >= maxLoops
		indicate problem
		keepGoing <- false
return estimate
```

### Results From Integration Exercises
- Calculated Integrals should work as expected if functions are implemented correctly
- Number of rectangles = $2^{\text{number of loops}}$
- Increased precision means better answers but more loops/rectangles required
- 30 `maxLoops` calculates $2^{30}$ or approximately 1 billion rectangles, so 30 or 35 or 40 `maxLoops` would be fine (slows down after 30)
- With precision 0, it goes on indefinitely until it reaches `maxLoops`
- for 31 loops or more, we need a long data type for the number rectangles stored since it will exceed an `int`
- For `FunctionWeird`, it doesn't come up with the right answer - it stops after 2 loops and 4 rectangles with the answer 32 instead of 29.87. This is because 2 successive estimates had the same value, which is how we are calculating this error and when to stop

*To make the left rectangle rule more efficient, see notes include Implementation notes in `Left Rectangle Rules Algorithm.docx` in particular:*
- we are multiplying by the same width, so we have
	- $f(3) * 1.5 + f(4.5) * 1.5 + f(6) * 1.5 + f(7.5) * 1.5$
	- $f(3) + f(4.5) + f(6) + f(7.5) * 1.5$ which saves a lot of calculations
- Note that since we double the number of rectangles we are re-using previous heights

## Using Trapezoids
![](Sample%20function%20for%20integration.xlsx)
*Trapezoid Rule* - Divide the area into multiple trapezoids and add up their areas
See *`Trapezoid Algorithm MATH-282-CST.docx`* for the algorithm

### Implementation
Required on Assignment 2

## Simpson's Rule
### Summary of Rules

| Left Rectangle | One Point (at left edge)                        | Created Rectangles (flat)<br>Degree 0 polynomial for each rectangle        | $Height * Width = f(left) * width$                                        |                                                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trapezoid Rule | Two points (Left and right edge)                | Created Trapezoids (line on top)<br>degree 1 polynomial for each trapezoid | $\frac 1 2 * (h1 + h2) * width = \frac 1 2 * f(left) + f(right)) * width$ | Exact answers for functions of straight lines ($f(x) = \frac 1 4 x$) |
| Simpson's Rule | 3 Points in each interval (Left, Right, Middle) | Create Parabolas (Curved on top)<br>Degree 2 polynomial for each part      | $\frac 1 6 * (h_{left} + 4 * f(middle) + f(right))/6 * width$             | Exact answers for polynomials up to degree 3                         |

### Algorithm
Same as for the rectangle and trapezoid rules, except that we use the area formula for a second degree polynomial instead of the area formula for a rectangle/trapezoid, which means that we also need the function value at $f(middle)$

### Implementation
