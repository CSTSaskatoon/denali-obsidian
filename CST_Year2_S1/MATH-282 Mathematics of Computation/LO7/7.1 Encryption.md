## Terminology
*Plaintext (P)* - The message to be encrypted
*Ciphertext (C)* - The output of the encryption process
*Cryptology (or cryptography)* - The art of devising ciphers

## Notation
Encryption can be described using the following function
$$
\color{lightgreen} C = E_k(P)
$$
Where $E_k$ is the encryption function based on some key, $k$
Decryption can be described using the following function
$$
\color{lightgreen} P = D_k(C)
$$
where $D_k$ is the Decryption process based on some key, $k$

## Substitution Ciphers
Each letter or group of letters is replaced by another letter or group of letters to disguise it. As an example, the alphabet can be mapped onto other letters as follows
![](Pasted%20image%2020241204080954.png)
So, for instance, the plaintext $P$ = "*welcome*"
The ciphertext would be $C$ = "*vtsegdt*"
This system is known as **monoalphabetic** substitution. This may appear as safe because there are $\color{yellow} 26! = 4 * 10^{26}$ possible keys.
however, statistical properties of the natural language makes it easy to break. 
Also, this process requires that each the sender and the receiver has the key - **how do we transmit the key securely?**

## Transposition Ciphers
Substitution ciphers preserve the order of the plaintext symbols but disguise them. Transposition ciphers reorder the letters, but don't disguise them. The cipher is based on a word or phrase not containing any repeating letters.
For example, say we wanted to encode the phrase $P$ = "*mathisthebestclass*"
The following cipher uses the key "*cipher*"

The purpose of the key is to number the columns from 1 with 1 being the closest to the start of the alphabet and so on.
We then read the columns vertically, starting with the lowest number to create the ciphertext $C$ = "*mttaiesehbadahcbtelcsssf*"
To decode the message, only the key is needed.
The problem then becomes "**How is the key transmitted securely to the intended receiver?**"
Also, the process is relatively easy to crack

## Public/Private keys
Modern encryption systems involve a public and private key.
**The method of encryption is also public**.
One of the strengths of the method is that the private key (what decrypts the message) is not transmitted

### RSA
The challenge of public key cryptography is to develop a system in which it is impossible/extremely difficult to determine the private key.
This is done through a **one-way function**.
With a one-way function, it is relatively easy to compute a result given a set of input values. However, it is extremely difficult to determine the original value starting with only the result.
The one-way function used in RSA is simply the multiplication of 2 prime numbers (1024 bit or more)
It is easy to multiply two primes to get a result, but given the result, it can be extremely time consuming to factor

$21 = 3 * 7$
$91 = 7 * 13$
$1073 = 29 * 37$

Must determine the factors by using "brute-force" techniques".
Public key cryptography uses functions like this to build a **cryptosystem**, or in other words to build a private key and the product of primes to build the public key. 
This function is one-way for large prime numbers (1024 bit minimum)

#### Steps for RSA
1. Begin by taking two large prime numbers (1024 bit minimum) called $\color{yello} p$ and $\color{yellow} q$. Calculate their product as $\color{lightgreen}n = p * q$
2. Calculate the public key and private key as follows
	1. Calculate the **modulus** $\color{lightgreen}z = (p - 1) * (q - 1)$
	2. pick an arbitrary number $\color{yellow} e$ such that
		1. $\color{lightblue} e < z$
		2. $\color{yellow} e$ and $\color{yellow} z$ must be **relatively prime**, which means that their greatest common factor is 1
	3. Compute a number $\color{yellow} d$ such that $\color{lightgreen}ed \% z = 1$
	4. The public key is ($\color{yellow}n, e$) and the private key is ($\color{yellow}n, d$)
3. To send a message, the public key is passed to the sender. The sender encrypts the message with the formula $\color{lightgreen}C = P^e \% n$
4. The recipient then decodes the message using the formula $\color{lightgreen} P = C^d \% n$

#### Example of RSA
A recipient picks the values $\color{yellow} p  = 3$ and $\color{yellow} q = 11$ (in reality these would be much bigger)
$\color{lightgreen} n = p * q = 3 * 11 = 33$
Calculate the modulus
$\color{lightgreen} z = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = (3 - 1) * (11 - 1) = 2 * 10 = 20$
Pick a number according to the rules
$\color{yello} e = 7$
(7 is prime but $\color{yellow}e$ does not have to be prime as long as it's relatively prime to 20 and it's less than 20. We could have also picked 9, which isn't prime.)

Computer $\color{yellow} d$ according to the formula
$$
\color{lightgreen}ed \%z = 1
$$
$$
\color{lightgreen}7d \%20 = 1
$$
$$
\color{lightgreen}7d = \%20 + 1
$$
Solve for $\color{yellow} d$
$$
\color{lightgreen}d = (20x + 1) / 7
$$
try $\color{yellow} x = 1$
$$
\color{lightgreen}d = (20 * 1 + 1) / 7 = 21/7 = 3
$$
Since this is an integer value, we use it. If it didn't work, try $x = 2$, $x = 3$, etc.
Public key is ($\color{yellow}n, e$) = ($\color{yellow} 33, 7$)
Private key is ($\color{yellow}n, d$) = ($\color{yellow}33, 3$)

To send a message, the receiver would send the public key to the sender of the message.
Suppose the sender wants to send the message $\color{yellow} p = 13$ (Notice that the value of $P$ that we are encrypting must be less than the modulus $\color{yellow} z$)
Encrypt using the formula
$$
\color{lightgreen} C = P^e \% n = 13^7 \% 33 = 7
$$
The sender transmits $\color{yellow} C = 7$
The recipient decodes using the private key ($\color{yellow} 33, 3$)
$$
\color{lightgreen} P = C^d \% n = 7^3 \% 33 = 343 \% 33 = 13
$$

#### Example 2
 $\color{yellow} p  = 17$ and $\color{yellow} q = 23$ 
$\color{lightgreen} n = p * q = 17 * 23 = 391$
$\color{lightgreen} z = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = 16 * 22 = 352$
Pick a number $\color{yellow} e = 29$
Compute $\color{yellow} d$ according to $\color{lightgreen} ed \% z = 1$, so $\color{lightgreen} 29d \% 352 = 1$, so $\color{lightgreen} 29d = 352x + 1$, so $\color{lightgreen} d = (352x + 1)/29$ for some integer $\color{yellow} x$. By trial and error, we arrive at $\color{yellow} d = 85$ (when $\color{yellow} x = 7$).

So the public key is ($\color{yellow} n, e$) = ($\color{yellow} 391, 29$)
Private key is ($\color{yellow} n, d$) = ($\color{yellow} 391, 85$)

Suppose the sender wishes to send the message "**HI**" with "H" being encoded as 8 and "I" being encoded as 9
$\color{lightgreen}C = P^e \% n = 8^{29} \% 391 = 196$
$\color{lightgreen}C = P^e \% n = 9^{29} \% 391 = 280$

So the sender transmits $\color{yellow}196$ and $\color{yellow}280$
The recipient gets $\color{yellow}196$ and $\color{yellow}280$ and decodes it using the private key
$\color{lightgreen}P = C^d \% n = 196^{85} \% 391 = 8$
$\color{lightgreen}P = C^d \% n = 280^{85} \% 391 = 9$

#### Additional RSA Details
A practical way to use the algorithm is to convert the message to **hexadecimal** and perform encryption and decryption steps on each octet (8 bits) individually

A popular choice for the public exponent $\color{yellow} e = 2^{16} + 1 = 65537$
- smaller devices often user smaller values to make encryption faster, but at the expense of greater security risks

Exponent calculations in formulas $\color{lightgreen} C = P^e \% n$ and $\color{lightgreen} P = C^d \% n$ are done by **Exponentiation by Squaring** which has an efficiency of $\color{red} O(\log n)$ versus $\color{red} O(n)$ when just multiplying a value by itself $\color{yellow} n$ times

Plaintext values $\color{yellow} P$ are padded in practice since certain values such as 0 and 1 as 0 and 1 respectively

Steps for determining e and d can be done using the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** (rather than brute force testing for d as shown above)

For comparably secure systems, it has been possible to achieve a throughput of 1000 to 10000 times higher for single-key algorithms than two-key algorithms (like RSA).
- As a result, the main application of a two-key algorithm is used for authentication and digital signatures or to exchange a randomly generated session key to be used with a single-key algorithm at high speed for main communication.
- At the end of the session the key is discarded
