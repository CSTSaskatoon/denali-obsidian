## Threat Hunting
Figuring out the problems you might run into (Attack vectors, vulnerabilities)
Iterative approach
Specific techniques threat actors will use

### Types
- *Data driven* - unusual traffic, log files, etc. (your organization)
- *Intel Driven* - Getting data from other sources (other organizations)
- *Entity driven* - Looking at one particular device
- *TTP driven* - Tactics, Techniques, procedures 
- *Hybrid*

### Maturity Model
Higher the level, the more data and quality of data
Levels 0 - 4
Security is starting to rely a lot on AI for the analysis (Trends, techniques, etc.)

### Considerations
Have to analyze large amounts of data, and a way to get the data
Don't just rely on one thing
Threat feeds - collection of attacks that are common or have happened recently

## Cyber-Threat Intelligence
Collection of data and analysis

### Types
Strategic - Long term, high level
Tactical - Long term, low level
Operational - Short term, high level
Actions - Short term, low level

### Layers
Providers
- Professional Services
- Platforms
- Feeds
- Sources

### Feeds
Any place you gather information

*Public*
- SHODAN
- dark web
- Virus Total
- Threat Connect

*Commercial*
- MS Cyber Trust blog
- Kasperkey
- FireEye
- IBM X-Exchange

### Sources
*Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)*
- Internet articles
- media
- public
- literature

*Human Intelligence (HUMINT)*
- individual person has knowledge
- Not very common

*Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)*
- CIA
- Intercepted signals
- military level

*Technical Intelligence (TECHINT)*
- Foreign equipment
- satellites
- technical research papers
- human contacts

*Social Media Intelligence (SOCMINT)*
- Hard to use because it's always changing
- Have to get into their groups which may be difficult
- Telegram used to be popular but people are moving away from it

*Cyber Counterintelligence (CCI)*

*Indicators of Compromise (ioCs)*
- Commercial and industry sources
- network security breaches

*Commercial sources*
- Big companies
- Blogs

*Government*
- FBI Cyber Crime
- CERIAS blog
- StopThinkConnect

## Deep and Dark Web Searching
*Surface*
- Google

*Deep web*
- Can get to if you use slightly different search engines

*Dark web/net*
- Have to know what you're looking for
- Tor, Freenet, GNUnet, I2P, OneSwarm

## AI and Predictive Analysis for Threat Hunting
people used to be great but very slow at finding patters, AI is getting good at it now

## Standards and formats for sharing Threat Intelligence
*CybOX* - sending data
*STIX* - how to report
*TAXII*
in the background

## Vulnerability research
Not threat hunting anymore

### Vulnerability Assessment
here's where the problem is, how do we fix it
before the attacker finds it

### What you get from Vulnerability scanning
Passwords, open ports, running services, etc.

### Approaches
*Active* - LDAP queries, SQL injection, port scanning
*passive* - do this first, find the vulnerabilities first

### Scoring systems and databases
Common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
0 - 10

#### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
Telling you what the problem is, but not the severity

#### National Vulnerability database (NVD)
Combines everything (CVE, CVSS)

#### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
not as common, same as CVE

### Types of Vulnerability Assessment
- *Active*
- *Passive*
- *External*
- *Internal*
- *Host-based*
- *Network-based*
- *Application*
- *database*
- *Wireless network* - horrible for security
- *Credentials*
- *Manual* - Looking for new vulnerabilties
- *Distributed* - any part of a whole process (Firewall, proxy, web server, etc.)
- *Non-credential* - What can you find out when not logged in
- *Automated* - Known vulnerabilities

### Management life cycle
ISRARV - Identify, Scan, Risk Assessment, Remediation, Verification
- I slapped Randy and Randy's Vagina

### Assessment tools
*Qualys* - cloud based, good to see what an attacker could do
*OpenVAS*
*GFI LanGuard*
*Nessus*

## Ethical Hacking
actual techniques of real attackers **WITH PERMISSION**
Don't harm the system even if they are real attacks, have restrictions

### Why it's good
Beat the attackers to the punch (stop them before they try it)
Exploring potential security risks - What are you able to do by exploiting it?
How good is your detection?
Budget?

### Scope and Limitations
*Scope*
- company should know what you're trying to test

*Limitations*
- get a signed contract
- confidentiality

### Skills
Knowledge of the operating systems, technical domains, etc.

### What is Pen Testing
Trying to exploit vulnerabilities to see what the attacker could do
Most thorough way of testing stuff

### Benefits of Pen Testing
Shows the actual risk and the results of what could happen

### ROI for Pen Testing
Big thing is will this attack test be more valuable to you or not?
Sometimes required by industry (security audit)

### Rules of Engagement
What you are and aren't allowed to do
legal protection
Scope and RoE are handled independently

### Security Audit
Are you following the policies (are people properly changing their passwords every week)

### Red Team vs Blue Team
Could be with or without warning

### Purple Team and White Team
White team - negotiators (RoE)
Purple team - red and blue team members

### Goals
Goal oriented - can I get into this server?
Compliance oriented - Are we meeting the industry standard? Not worried about other  vulnerabilities
Red team oriented - no specific driver, just find any flaws

### Strategies
*Black Box* - outsider
*White Box* - insider, knows how the system works
*Grey Box*

### Process
Define the scope, Perform the Pen Test, Reporting/Delivering results

### Methodologies
Proprietary
- EC-Council
- IBM
- ISS
- McAfee

Open Source
- CREST
- bunch of other shit

Same concept for all

### Asset management
Can be hardware, software, intellectual property

### Configuration Management
You know everything about the switch physically, but do you know the settings and how it's set up?

### Change Management
Whenever you make a change for the security/usability of a device, document it
