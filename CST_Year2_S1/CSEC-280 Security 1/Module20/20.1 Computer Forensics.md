# Computer Forensics
*The process of looking at cyber crime*
Procedures and techniques that help identify, preserve, extract, etc. in a way that can be used in court
Intent counts

## When to use
Prepare for incidents
Identify actions needed for response
Copyright
Estimate damages
Formulate norms

## Types
- *Internal/Insider*
- *External*
- Espionage
- Intellectual property theft
- Data manipulation
- Trojan horse
- SQL attack
- Brute force
- Phishing
- Privilege escalation
- DoS
- Cyber defamation
- Cyberterrorism
- Cyberwarfare

## Impacts
- Theft of sensitive data
- Financial loss
- Customer and shareholder trust
- Disruption of business activities

## Digital Evidence
Any information of probative value stored/transmitted in digital form
Circumstantial and fragile in nature
*"Anyone or anything entering a crime scene takes something of the scene with them, and leaves something of themselves behind when they leave" - Locard's Exchange Principle*

### Types
Volatile data

non-volatile data

### Roles
- Identity Theft
- Malicious attacks on computers
- Information leaks
- Unauthorized transmission of information

### Sources
*User Created Files*
*User Protected Files*
*System Files*

### Rules
- Understandable
- Admissible
- Authentic
- Reliable
- Complete

### Federal Rules of Evidence
don't want this to take forever and we don't want it to cost a fortune

### Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE)
- Standards for examining and storing digital evidence
- Makes sure it's accurate
- agency has to keep copies of technical procedures

### Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Principles of Digital Evidence
- no action taken by law enforcement should change the data 

## What makes a good Investigator
- Interviewing skills
- Writing skills
- Analytical skills
- Communication skills
- Updated about methodologies
- Well versed in more than one computer platform
- Knowledge of various technologies, hardware, software
- Has contacts
- Has knowledge of the law relevant to the case

## Methodology
- Document
- Search and Seizure
- Evidence Preservation
- Data acquisition
- Data analysis
- Case Analysis
- Reporting
- Testifying as an Expert witness

## Search and Seizure
Seek consent
Obtain witness signatures
Obtain warrant
Collect incident info
Seize evidence

## Evidence Preservation
- Documentation is key

## Data Acquisition
- process of imaging or collecting data
- can't alter data
- complete process should be auditable

## Data analysis
examine, identify, separate, convert and model data to isolate useful information

## Case Analysis
More the legal side
relate evidential data to the case to get the full scope
Make a decision to keep pursuing or not
Statute of limitations

## Gathering and Organizing Information
- Summarize everything

## Testifying as an Expert Witness
- be familiar with the usual procedures
- Attorney introduces expert witness
- Apposing council may try to discredit the expert witness
- Attorney leads expert witness through the evidence
- Followed by cross-examination

## Log Files
Network Logs
System Logs
Security Logs
Web Logs
DNS Logs
Dump files
Authentication Logs
SIP Logs

## Security Solutions
*Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) Dashboards*
*Sensors*
*Sensitivity*
*Automated Alerts*
*Correlation* - integrate multiple logs into one thing

## Evidence Sources
- Bandwidth Monitors
- Metadata
- *Couple here I missed*
- Vulnerability scan
- Protocol analyzer output (SIEM Capture)

## Collection and Perseveration of Evidence
Applicable jurisdiction/legislation
Chain of custody
Details on equipment containing evidence
Backups
Approval

## Collecting Physical Evidence
- Electronic devices or any other media found at the crime scene
- preservation

## Dealing with Powered On Computers
- Photograph everything
- Document running programs
- If a portable screen wakes up, document it
- For portable computers, turn it off and remove the battery

## Dealing with Powered off computers
- if it's off, leave it off

## Dealing with Networked Computers
- Unplug the network cable from the modem
- Photograph all devices

## Open Files and Startup Files
malware likely opens itself on startup
Document date and time of files

## Evidence Management
logbook
tag that identifies evidence
chain of custody record

## Chain of Custody
Legal document that details progression of evidence
should list all info about the evidence, people that handled it, etc.

## Data Acquisition
Establish methods to extract Electronically stored Information (ESI)
Live - computer is on
Dead/Static - Computer is off

### Live
Can follow live acquisition with a dead acquisition
System and network data (caches)

## Order of Volatility
Typical order is
- Registers and cache
- Routing table, process table, kernel statistics, memory
- Temp system files
- Disk or other storage media
- Remote logging and monitoring data that is relevant to the system
- Physical config, network
- Archival media

## Types of Data acquisition
Logical
- Only capture files relevant to the case

Sparse
- collect fragments of unallocated data ("deleted" files)

Bit-Stream Imaging
- clone of the drive

Bit-Stream disk to image
- most common

Bit-Stream disk to disk
- suspect drive is old
- Tools can adjust the target disk's geometry

## Acquire Volatile data
data lost when computer shuts down
