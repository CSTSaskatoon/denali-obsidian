# Cryptography
Conversion of data into scrambled code an sent across a public or private network
keep the data confidential and in one piece

## Encryption
### Symmetric
Old
Same key is used to encrypt/decrypt

### Asymmetric
public/private keys
small amounts of data

### Government Access to Keys (GAK)
Software companies give copies of keys/parts of keys to crack to the government
Basically like the ability to wiretap phones

### Cyphers
Algorithms used to encrypt/decrypt data
can be based on input data or keys

### Data Encryption Standards (DES)
encipher and decipher blocks of data consisting of 64 bits under control of a 56-bit key

### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
Symmetric key algorithm used by the government

### Algorithms
**RC4**
**RC5**
**RC6**

### Digital Secure Algorithm (DSA) and RSA

### Other techniques
**Elliptic Curve Cryptology** - depends on elliptic curves
**Quantum Cryptography**
**Homomorphic Encryption** - secure data even when it's being processed/manipulated
**TPM** - chip on your motherboard
**HSM** - external security device
**USB Encryption**
**Hard Drive Encryption**
**Post-Quantum**
**Lightweight** - used for RFID, IoT, etc.

## Cipher Modes of Operation
**Electric Code Book Mode**
**Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode**
**Cipher Feedback (CFB) Mode**
**Counter Mode**

## Limitations
- Speed
- Key size
- Weak keys
- time required to encrypt
- Longevity
- Predictability
- reuse
- Entropy - how variable the generated keys are
- Computed overhead
- Resources vs security constraints

## Key Stretching
**PBKDF2**
**Bcrypt**

## MD5 and MD6
*MD5 is not collision resistent*
MD6 use Merkle tree-like structure

## Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA)
secure one-way hash
SHA-1 resembles MD5
SHA-3 uses sponge construction

## Hash Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
embedded hash function such as SHA-1 or MD5

## Modes of Authenticated Encryption

## Digital Signatures
Uses asymmetric key algo to provide data integrity
![700](Pasted%20image%2020241114102608.png)

## Key Exchange through Digital Envelopes
Encrypts keys and data with another key

## Perfect Forward Security (PFS)
Protects previously encrypted session data, even if the private key of the server is compromised

## Digital Certificates
Dealing with security concerns regarding the transmission of public keys

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
Certificate Authority (CA)
Registration Authority (RA)

### Trust Models
Set of rules/constraints that instructs a client application on how to verify the authenticity of digital certificates
*Peer to Peer Trust Model*
*Hybrid Trust Model*
*Bridge Trust Model*
*Web of Trust* - everyone in the network is a CA

### Online/Offline CA
intermediate CAs can be taken offline

## Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
Secure Associations (SA)
2 phases to get the initial public/private key, and then use that key in the 2nd phase

## Key Escrow and Certificate Chaining
Key Escrow - keeping secret keys with a certified 3rd party that serves as a backup
Certificate Chaining

## Certificate Pinning
Allows a client app to verify the server's cert using a pre-installed cert
protects against MITM

## Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
CRL - list of revoked certs
OCSP - alternative to CRL for checking status of cert revocation

## Certificate Stapling
Alternative to common OCSP method to determine revocation status

## OpenSSL
Open Source cmd line tool

## Windows Certificates

## Auth Protocols - Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)
most basic form of auth

## Shiva Password Authentication Protocol (S-PAP)
proprietary version of PAP

## Challenge Handshake Auth Protocol (CHAP)
one way hash function 

## Blockchain
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) records history of transaction

*Types*
- Public
- Private
- Federated
- Hybrid

## Steganography
Hiding secret messages within an ordinary message
Most common is using a graphic image as a cover
