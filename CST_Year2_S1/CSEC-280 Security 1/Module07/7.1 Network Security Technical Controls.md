## Protocols
- Radius - Remote Authentication Dial In User Service
- Pop3s - Connect to a server to retrieve emails (**old af, slow like dial up**)
- DNSSEC - Domain Name System Security Extensions
- SRTP - Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol
- SNMPv3 - Simple Network Management Protocol v3
- TACACS+ - Basically RADIUS but encrypts everything
- IMAPS - copying emails from server, old
- etc.

### RADIUS
When you connect to your home router, you put in a password
When you connect to a company router, you should log in with your own username/password on the router, which reaches out to the RADIUS server to authenticate
User can't connect directly to RADIUS server, have to go through an access point

### Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)
Replaces radius, encryption

### Kerberos
Authentication method using Kerberos Authentication Protocol (KAP)
Single-Sign on based on Ticket granting

### Secure Email Services
*Secure SMTP (SMPTS)*
*Secure POP (POP3S)*
*Secure IMAP (IMAPS)*
All based on Secure Socket Layer (SSL), public/private keys
Standalone system
Rarely send encrypted emails cause it's a pain

### Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
Gives the user the ability to send encrypted emails

### Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)
Attachments are technically text files because of how emails work

### DNSSEC
*Domain Name System Security Extensions*
Securing information provided by DNS
Guarantees authenticity, integrity, absence of a domain name/type
Doe not guarantee confidentiality, protection against DoS
digitally signing records using public-key cryptography

### Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP)
Alternative to HTTPS (SSL)
Not used anymore
designed for systems that could only do HTTP
public/private key is just for the initial connection
client sends symmetrical key (encrypted using public key) to server, and all connections after use the symmetrical encryption instead of public/private key because it's faster

### Transport Layer Security (TLS)
More secure than SSL, newer version

### Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
Developed by NetScape
uses RSA Asymmetric (public key) encryption 

### Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
advanced version of Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)
Doesn't use SSL

### Lightweight Directory Access Protocol over SSL (LDAPS)
secure version of LDAP using SSL/TLS
Every object in AD is an object which has properties
Can restrict access based on certificates
Hides AD queries

### Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)
Developed by the IETF for securing IP connections
Deployed widely to implement VPNs and remote use access through dial-up

Components
- IPsec driver
- Internet Key Exchange (IKE) (because it's machine-machine)
- Oakley

Benefits
- network-level peer auth
- etc.

Transport Mode
- encrypting the basic data

Tunnel Mode
- *EVERYTHING* is encrypted (original IP, data, cyclical redundancy etc.)
- All you see is the public IP request and destination

### Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
SSH2 protocol
port 22
Based on SSH which is based on SSL

### Secure Shell (SSH)
Network management protocol mainly used on Unix and Linux
mainly used for remote login
build encrypted tunnel
admins use a combination of username, password, port number for auth

### Open Authentication (OAuth)
Example of a *Federated Service*
Allows the user to grant limited access on one site with another site without having to expose credentials
Doesn't transfer user credentials between applications - uses auth tokens

### OpenID Connect (OIDC)
Auth protocol based on OAuth 2.0

### Network Segmentation
Breaking the network into segments (Marketing, Sales, etc.)
CST and CadCam

*Physical Segmentation*
- Wires go to different switches
- More secure
- Harder to do
- More work

*VLAN*
- Wires go to the same switch, but makes it look like they are physically separate
- Logical Separation
- More common
- Really easy to change

*Network Virtualization*

### Bastion Host
Something that's fortified
exposed to the dangers (public)
can come under attack and stand by itself
If it does fail, it contains nothing of value anyways
Firewall is the most common
'Sacrificial lamb'

#### Single-Homed
One interface (comes in and goes out the same place)
If this gets compromised, could lead to something getting inside

#### Multi-Homed
At least 2 interfaces (Come in one, go out the other)

#### Types
- *Non-Routing dual-homed hosts*
- *External Services hosts*
- *Victim Machines*
- *One-box firewalls*

### Network Segmentation Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
Semi-public network, semi-protected

#### Single Firewall
public reaches the firewall, decides who goes to the DMZ, which can then go back through the firewall to the internal network

#### Dual Firewall DMZ
public reaches firewall, decides who goes to the DMZ, then go through a second firewall to go to the internal network

### East-West and North-South Traffic
**East-West** - Inside your data center, use internal firewalls
**North-South** - public, outside clients, external firewalls
Most value North-South more, but East-West has more traffic

### Zero Trust Networks
Assumes every user accessing the network is not trusted by default
Very common with BYOD
Go through all the systems an outside client would
Can be done using MFA, encryption, PAM

### Firewalls
Software or hardware
allow non-threatening traffic in and keep the threatening traffic out
Packet filtering

#### Internal
Segmenting the network, firewall can make more decisions

#### External
Separating public from internal/DMZ

#### Packet Filtering
Rules for who is allowed to talk to who, and what ports are allowed

Criteria
- Source/Destination IP address
- Source/Destination Port
- Protocol
- Ex. Brody can only talk to Doug on Port 80 on UDP

Last rule should be deny everything (didn't pass any of the other rules at this point)

### Circuit-Level Gateway
Doesn't look at every individual packet, just setting up the conversation
Faster cause it doesn't filter individual packets

### Application Level Gateways
cares about the data in the packet itself
"Does this look like legit web traffic"
Significantly slower
Specific to their task (Web gateway can't read email requests)

### Stateful Multilayer Inspection Firewall
Combines the 3 Gateways
Generic

### Application Proxy
Gateway between you and the internet

### Network Address Translation (NAT)
private IP hits the NAT and assigns you a public
PAT is more common because multiple people likely want to use the public IP at the same time
Outside world never sees the private IPs

### Virtual Private Network (VPN)
Taking the packets on each side and wrap it in an encrypted packet, send it on the internet until it reaches the network you want

### Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
Works a lot like an application (looks at the data)
Can decrypt packets if it's set up for it

### Firewall Capabilities
Perform Logging, filtering and controlling traffic

### Firewall Limitations
Probably won't prevent backdoor attacks
Can only protect against internal attacks if it's internal
not an alternative to antivirus/antimalware, password management, etc.

### Firewall Access Control Lists
Source and destination IP, protocol, port, sometimes MAC

## Best Practices
Filter out all ports you don't need
If you're running double firewalls, try not to have too many overlapping ports
Have special accounts for managing the Firewalls (Not admin)
Change default passwords
Have the minimum amount of programs running
General maintenance (update rules)
Don't rely on packet filtering alone

## Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
For an attacker to try and get into your system, they need to know what ports are open
IDS should detect stuff like port scanning
IPS should block IPs and stuff once the detection goes off

### IDS
Works from inside the system
Can be host-based (On each machine)
Heuristic pattern matches/signatures
*Signature recognition* - fast, easy, catch the easy stuff
*Anomaly Detection* - have to know what normal is first, needs to be updated when thing change
*Protocol Anomaly Detection*

### Limitations
Not a vulnerability assessment tool
Just looking for strange behaviour
Put it in a location where most of the traffic goes through
Should only alert you when there is actually a problem (false positives)
Should also be looking at outbound traffic

### Indications of Intrusion
*File System* - mostly used on antivirus
*Network* - protocols being used, vast majority
*System* - log files being modified, things changing

### Signature Based Detection
Doesn't pick up new threats
Give less false positives

### Anomaly Based Detection
Need to train it
more customizable
Good to run signature an anomaly

### Stateful Protocol Analysis
Lot like signature
Set of rules for a protocol
Looks for predetermined ideas (packet size, etc.)

### Protection Based
Host based (HIDS) is on your machine (mostly antivirus)
Network based (NIDS) is on the network

### Structure Based
Centralized control

### Analysis Timing Based
Get updates in the morning
Good for overall monitoring, but need active analysis (real time)

### Source Data Analysis Based
Audit trails, log files, packets

### IDS Components
- Network Sensors
- Alert Systems
- Command Console
- Response System

### Command Console
Software that lets you see whats going on
Monitoring

### Attack Signature Database
What antiviruses use
Compares program against known bad pattern

### Deploying Network Based IDS
The more network traffic we see, the better it will perform

### Deploying a Host Based IDS
On individual machines
Mostly anti virus, but many different types

### Types of IDS Alerts
True positive - Good actor gets in (Good)
False positive - Bad actor gets in (Bad)
False negative - Good actor gets denied (Bad)
True negative - Bad actor gets denied (good)

### Characteristics of Good IDS
Should run without people (other than alerts)
Resistant to subversion
Not easily deceived

## Honeypots
Resource set up to attract and trap people who attempt to penetrate a network
Works as an IDS

### Types
Low interaction - program that makes it look like a login page for the server, nothing actually behind it
- more interaction makes it take them longer

Pure honeypot would emulate a real production network - be careful of sensitive data
Tar pit is just a slow down to give you time (how often you can enter passwords, pages load slower)

### Production honeypots
help find internal flaws, distract you

### Research honeypots
learn about attack patterns

### More types
- Malware
- Database - SQL injection, database enumeration
- Spam
- Email
- Spider
- Honeynets

## Proxy Servers
Caching, monitoring, hiding your identity

### Benefits
Act as a protector between user devices and a server
logging activity

### Proxy Servers vs Packet Filters
If the proxy fails, network traffic would stop
if packet filter fails, traffic may or may not go through
Proxy examines packet data
Packet filter examines routing information

### Types
#### Transparent
User doesn't have to do anything, set up by router

#### SOCKS
made for specific programs
Almost like a VPN
Use different ports for different applications

#### Anonymous
Hides your information more than a regular proxy
Servers are somewhere else, used for Geofencing

#### Reverse
Takes the outside people and funnels them somewhere inside the server
Everyone goes to the proxy, proxy talks to the web server

### Limitations
SPOF
Take on a lot of work

## VPNs
Tunneling, encapsulation
Packet is encapsulated in the data portion of another packet, which is then sent through the public network
encapsulated packet never talks to the internet
Doesn't have to be encrypted, but should be
Different than remote desktop

### Why they are useful
Geographical extension (Work network from anywhere) is the main benefit

### Components
- Client
- Remote server

### Concentrators
Used to create VPN connections
Manages the tunnels, encryption systems, etc.
bi-direction tunnel endpoint (connection coming or going out)

### Types
Client - Site
Site - Site - Server to server VPN to connect local networks, will likely need 2 concentrators
Hardware VPNs - Good by pricey
Software VPNs - Computer has to do more work, good enough for a single user

### Encapsulation
Protocols
- Point to Point (PPTP)
- Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) - modern one that everyone uses, but doesn't have encryption (Combine with IPSec)
- Secure Shell (SSH) - Built on SSL, fallback for L2TP
- IKE - computer to computer
- Socket Secure (SOCKS)

### Encryption
Maintain confidentiality of information

### Authentication
IPSec - can also do encryption
MS-CHAP
Kerberos

### Technologies
Trusted - You have control of the whole network, wires, etc.
Secure - Focused on encryption, don't have control of the network, public
Hybrid - Trusted and secure lines

### Topologies
Hub and spoke, full mesh, point to point, star

### Security Risks
Fingerprinting

### Firewalls
Can place the firewall before or after the VPN

### AAA Server (RADIUS)
This does the encryption, not the Concentrator

## User Behavior Analytics (UBA)
Looking for something happening differently
IDS, Heuristics

## Network Access Control (NAC)
Security policies, set of rules
basically a smarter firewall

## Web Content Filter
Server side most of the time
can be done on a gateway level
Can put them on search engines, emails, etc.

## Unified Thread Management (UTM)
Put everything in one box (web server, switch, firewall, router, etc.)
Cheaper than buying a bunch of devices
SPOF

## Security Incident and Event Management
Category of software
Monitor your network, analysis, take action
security and information management server
heuristics

## Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)
Technology to let you know How you act to information about threats and such

## Load Balancer
Splits traffic between servers
- Session Affinity - once you go to a server, you stay on that server
- Round Robin
- Least Connections
- Random Connections
