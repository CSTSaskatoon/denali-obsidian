**Identification** - proving who you are originally
**Authentication** - Logging in with password
**Authorization** - What you have access to once you're in

### Access Control
**Selective Restriction of access to an asset or system/network resource**
Protects things by determining who can access what

#### Terminology
**Subject**
**Object** - thing you are trying to access
**Reference Monitor** - typically OS, checks if you have authorization
**Operation** - action taken by the object

#### Principles
**Separation of Duties**
**Need-To-Know**
**Principle of Least Privilege** - By default you have no access, admin has to give you access to specific things

#### Models
**Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** - You create something, but only Admin owns it
**Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** - You create something, you can manage it
**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Usually very basic
**Rule-Based Access Control (RB-RBAC)** - permissions assigned to a user role dynamically based on a set of rules made by the admin

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Providing the right person the right access at the right time
![700](Pasted%20image%2020240924111404.png)

### Identity
Need someone to provide the identity
### User Identity Management (IDM)
**Who are you?**
**most common is passwords**
username, account #, role, etc.

### User Access Management (AM)
**What are you actually allowed to do? (Authorization)**
Controls various roles, groups

**Authentication**
- Something you know is the weakest
- Something you have (almost always physical, Ex. credit card, badge)
- Something you are (biometrics, voice recognition, retina scan, etc.

**Attributes**
- Somewhere you are (region locking)
- Something you do (Behavioral, kinda like biometric)
- Something you exhibit (Behavioral)
- Someone you know (I know ben, and you know ben)

### Password Authentication
Not good

### Two Factor Authentication
Involves two authentication factors
Combinations of authentication factors (Ex. password and smart token)

### Two Factor Auth Tokens
**Hardware Tokens** - physical devices, Ex. key fob/USB
**Software Tokens** - Single use login PIN

### Auth using Open Authentication (OATH)
One-Time-Password (OTP) is common
- Timed one time password is better because it changes

### Biometric Auth
**Fingerprint scanning**
**Retinal Scanning**
**Iris Scanning**
**Vein Structure Recognition**
**Facial Recognition**
**Voice Recognition**
**Gait Analysis**

#### Performance Metrics
**False Acceptance Rate (False positive)**
**False Rejection Rate (False negative)**

### Smart Card Authentication

### Single Sign On (SSO)
Allows the user to authenticate themselves to multiple servers with a single password and only signing on one time
**Federated Service** is SSO across platforms (MS Account on XBox and PC)

### Types of Auth Systems
**Centralized** - One server for everything
**Decentralized** - Each server has it's own access control, harder to manage but can be more custom
**Implicit** - Everything done through a token, works better with centralized
**Explicit** - sign in every time, decentralized

### Accounting/Auditing
Keep track of who does what (What files you open, etc.)
Looking for something that's gone wrong

### Account Types
**User Accounts**
**Guest Accounts**
**Service Accounts**
**Admin/Root Accounts**
**Privileged Accounts**
**Shared/Generic Accounts**
**Application/System/Service Accounts**
**Group-Based Accounts**
**Third-Party Accounts**
