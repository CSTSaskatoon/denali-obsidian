## Business Critical Data
important to business operation
- Accounting files
- databases
- licensed software
- contact information

## Need for data security
data is the ultimate access
physical authorization

## Data security
Prevents intentional or unintentional act of data misuse/modification

## Information Management Lifecycle
Creation
Organization
Utilization
Remediation
Storage
Erasure

## Data roles/responsibilities
Ownership
Controller
Processer
Data steward/custodian
etc.

## Classification
Levels
- Top secret
- Highly confidential
- Proprietary information
- Internal use
- public documents

## Technologies
Access Control
Encryption
masking
Resilience/backup
Destruction
Retention

## Access Control List (ACL)
who is allowed to access what folders/apps/resources/etc.
Can be done in Windows and Linux

## Encrypting Data at Rest
Disk Encryption
File Level
Database

### Disk Encryption
Can turn on through windows settings
can also use Bitlocker
- To Go is for removable Drives (Flash Drives, SD Cards, External Drives, Other drives formatted by NTFS, etc.)

### Database Encryption
Transparent/External - symmetric
Column-level - encrypts individual columns
Symmetric - enhanced transparent, remains encrypted until opened
Asymmetric

## Data in Transit
Stop sending so much stuff in texts/emails
Secure your HTTP connection through a digital cert (or just use HTTPS)

## Data masking
Character Scrambling
Lookup substitution
Nulling out/deletion
Shuffling
Number/date variance
Masking out

## Deidentification methods
Masking - replace critical info with `******`
Bucketing
Tokenizing
Hashing/salting

## Data breach notifications/escalations
type of data affected
extent of the breach
how many subjects are concerned

have to let your end users that are affected by it

## Data Sharing and Privacy Agreements
Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA)
Data sharing and Usage agreement
Service-level agreement (SLA)
Confidentiality and Non-disclosure Agreement (CNDA)

## Rights Management Services
augment the security strategy using Information Rights Management
Prevents info from being printed, saved, shared, etc. without authorization

## Data Backup
duplicate copy of critical data
reinstate a system to it's working state or recover data
avoid severe damage to companies' assets

Selecting
- Reliability
- Usability
- Speed
- Cost
- Availability
- Confidentiality

Examples
- DVD
- Portable drives
- Tape Drives

## Storage Area Networks (SAN)
Connects storage devices to the network

*Advantages*
- Easy data sharing
- Improved backup
- High performance, low latency
- high availability
- Scalability

## Network Attached Storage
*Advantages*
- usable with all OS
- connected to LAN easily (plug and play)
- Minimal admin required

*Disadvantages*
- will use a lot of network performance if you are transferring lots of data
- Uses TCP/IP

## Backup Methods
Hot
- Server is online
- expensive
- Used when you want no downtime
- backup switch over is fast

Cold
- cheaper
- Server is not running
- downtime is required
- requires more time
- backup everything
- backup switch over is slow

Warm
- Nearline
- Less accessible than hot backup

## Types of Backups
Full/Normal - restoration is fast, storage is slow
Differential - mid
Incremental - fast to restore, storage is fast, slow to full restore

## Data retention best practices
Create policy that follows business requirements
Justify
Start creating policy with minimal requirements
Create
Create
Retain
Implement
Classify

## Data Destruction
Shredding and degaussing is best for drives
Don't forget stuff like SIM cards, photocopier drives, etc.

## Data loss prevention
Stops people from sending information out of the organization

Endpoint - specific devices themselves
Network - perimeter around network to stop stuff from going out
Storage

*Best Practices*
- identify data to protect
- whitelist to prevent false positives
