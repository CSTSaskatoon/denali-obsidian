## Importance of Physical Security
If you don't have physical security, you don't really have security
Restricting unauthorized physical access
If I can take a computer home I can crack it in as much time as I want

## Attack Vectors
### Natural Threats
- Floods - Middle floor is best because the basement floods and the roof can leak
- Fires
- Earthquakes
- Lightning/Thunder
- Temperature/humidity - too low humidity = static electricity, too high = corrosion
- Outcome is the same as if somebody breaks your computer with a bat or there's a flood
- Good idea to have a dedicated server room because then you can not have sprinklers in it

### Man-Made
- Vandalism
- Device loss (unintentional)
- Damage of physical devices
- Theft
- Terrorism
- Social engineering
- Unauthorized access

## Types of Physical Security Controls
Preventative
Detective
Deterrent - make sure people at least *think* you have cameras and security measures
Recovery
Compensating

## Location Considerations
Visibility of assets
Neighboring buildings
Local considerations
Impact of catastrophic events
Joint Tenancy risks - have good walls

## Site Architecture Considerations
1. Identify Critical Infrastructure
2. have separate location for server and storage room
3. Identify safety measures
4. Have emergency exits
5. Make plans to manage environmental hazards
6. Define who will be responsible for managing the systems
7. Establish procedures
8. Proper sanitation systems
9. Keep parking away from the main building

## Fire Fighting Systems
*Active Fire Protection (manual or automatic)*
- Fire detection
- Fire suppression
*Passive (structural considerations)*
- use fire-resistant materials
- Compartmentalization of the building
- Emergency exits
- Emergency procedures
- Minimizing inflammable sources

## Physical Barriers
Visible through (someone can't hide behind the fence)
residential very different than industrial
bollards, turnstiles
Doors, windows, grills, glass, curtains, etc.

## Security Personnel
Sometimes not great
- fall asleep
- can be bribed

Sometimes can be good
- recognize things a computer wouldn't

## Security Access/Badges
Could be an ID, RFID tag
Color coding access levels

## Physical Locks
*Mechanical, Digital, Combination, Electronic/Electromagnetic*
- Most digital locks still have a mechanical lock

## Contraband/Concealed Weapons
- Materials that are banned
- Tools such as handheld metal detectors, x-ray inspection systems, etc.

## Mantraps
- Not dangerous
- Two doors, authorization once in between the two doors (Trapped if you aren't authorized)

## Warning Signs
 - Deterrent

## Alarm/Sensor Systems
Should be audible to everyone
can be used manually or automatically

Types
- Passive infrared
- Circuit based
- Infrasonic
- Motion
- Proximity - RFID tags

## Video Surveillance
Can be deterrent or detective, or both

## Lighting
Depends on the situation
- If you keep everything dark, a flashlight is easier to see
- Good lighting can make it easier to spot stuff

## Power Supplies
- Standby
- Line Interactive
- Standby on-line hybrid

## Reception Area
- Large enough for people to see
- No blind corners
- Where your business meets the public
- Should keep an eye open for suspicious activity
- Shouldn't be able to see the computer

## Visitor Logs
- Logbook
- Visitor badges if your business has badges
- Emergency notifications

## Critical Access and Removable Devices
- Locked cabinets
- Biometric locks
- restrict use of removable devices
- Acceptable use policies
- Inventory management
- BYOD policies

## Security Network Cables
- Should go through conduits
- can bypass a lot of security by swapping cables out and plugging in a laptop or something
- Can use proximity or pressure on conduits to let you know when someone is tampering with the cables

## Securing Portable Devices
- Encryption
- Labeling devices could be good or bad (Make you a target)
	- Resell value goes down
	- Easier to find it if stolen

## Heating, Ventilation and AC
- People like it hot, Computers like it cold
- HVAC should be on it's own network

## Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Shielding
- Interferes with network cables, might have to run fiber optic if it's bad

## Hot and Cold Aisles
- Manage hot and cold air in server room
- saves hardware from humidity and heat
