# Virtualization and Cloud Computing
*Demarcation*
## Virtualization
*networks, devices, application, storage, etc.*
Full, OS assisted (para), hardware assisted (hybrid)
Different levels - storage, file, server

### Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
devices connect to broker (server) which gives them an instance of a virtual desktop
saskpoly VDI failed cause they only had 1 hypervisor

### Security and Concerns
#### Containers
Kernel functionality is replicated on multiple instances (containers)
Containers as a Service (CaaS) includes virtualization of containers and management through orchestrators
useful if you don't care about the OS, just the environment

*OS containers* - Use an OS to run multiple applications
*Application Containers*

#### Microservices
belong in a single application
smaller parts of an application used in containers

#### Kubernetes (K8s)
managing containerized applications and microservices

Kubernetes vs Docker
- Docker is open source
- Can use Kubernetes to manage docker hosts

### Container Security
Image, Registry and Container Threats

Host OS Threats, Orchestrator Threats
- Orchestrator is unbounded admin access

#### Docker Security
Escaping, Cross Container, Inter Container, Docker Registry attacks

#### Kubernetes Security Challenges and Threats

### Serverless Computing
Function As a Server (FaaS)
- moves the demarcation point

### VM Sprawl Awareness
VMs having too many versions
Perform audits, protect idle resources, remove unnecessary backups, etc.

### VM Escape Protection
Keep your Easily escapable services in the same area (small importance)
Only install what's required on the VM

### OS virtualization security practices
Restrict write access, keep tabs on resources

### Kubernetes security practices
Validation of file contents
assure credential paths
use well tested JSON libraries for constructing objects

### Serverless Security
Minimize permissions
Monitor
use third party tools
Make sure you sanitize inputs

## Cloud Computing
### Benefits
Highly operational
Business agility
standardization
disaster recover

### Typical Services
Infrastructure as a service
Platform as a service
Security as a Service
Anything as a Service
Container as a Service
Function as a Service

### Customer vs CSP Shared Responsibilities
Depending on what you use in the cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) you are responsible for everything you do on-premises

### Cloud Deployment models
Public, Private, Community, Hybrid, Multi

### On premises, hosted, Cloud
On-premises
- everything depends on you
- can be expensive to maintain
- need people who know what they're doing

Cloud
- Third party owns the infrastructure
- Some stuff depends on you, some on provider

### Cloud Storage Architecture
Everything is just another computer

### Fog computing
Distributed and independent digital environment
intermediary, intelligent gateway

### Edge computing
Decentralized
processing performed close to edge devices

### Cloud Security
responsibility shared between provider and customer
demarcation point
usually IAM is left to the customer

Compliance
- regulation and standards for you to follow

Data Storage
- stored on inter-connected servers

Monitor
- data replication, file name changes, who accesses data

network security
- makes it harder to monitor

Logging
- security logs

### AWS IAM
securely control access to AWS services
Lock your account root user access keys
Create individual IAM users depending on what they need
Use groups to assign permissions

Grant least privilege, conditional access

### Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
can be offered as SaaS
change demarc point

### Securing the Cloud
virtual private Cloud (VPC)
public and private subnets

Cloud Application Security
High availability across zones

Integration and Auditing
Security Groups
instance awareness
- don't want some fake cloud instance beside my cloud

have a cloud security compliance checklist
- know what's in your demarcation point

International Cloud Security Organizations provide info and best practices
Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) is like a middle man between you and the cloud provider
