## Mobile Device Attacks
Phones, Laptops, USB Keys
- USB keys are good because they are used between people and many different machines

### Security issues with App stores
- Bad vetting of apps leads to malicious and fake apps
- App stores are common targets for attackers to distribute malware and malicious aps
- malicious apps can damage other applications and data, and send your sensitive data to attackers

### Sandboxing issues
Helps protect systems and users by limiting the resources the app can access to the mobile platform; however, malicious applications may bypass the sandbox

### Mobile Spam
- Unsolicited text/email messages sent to mobile devices from known/unknown phone number and email IDs
- Spam messages contain advertisements or malicious links that can trick users into revealing confidential information
- Significatn amount of wasted bandwidth
- Spam attacks are performed for financial gain

### SMS Phishing Attack (SMiShing)
Trying to acquire personal and financial information by sending SMSs (Instant messages or IMs) containing deceptive linksS

### Pairing Mobile devices on open bluetooth/WiFi connections
Allows attackers to eavesdrop and intercept data transmission using techniques such as
- Bluesnarfing (Stealing info)
- Bluebugging (Gaining control)

### Android Rooting
Allows android users to attain priviliged control with android's subsystem

### Using Metasploit on Android
Toolkit of attack methods

## IoT and OT Attacks
### DDoS attacks
Attacker initiates the attack by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the devices and installing malicious software
multiple infected IoT devices are a botnet

### Rolling Code Attack
Garage doors, keyless entry

### BlueBorne
Gain control of a device with Bluetooth

### Software Defined Radio (SDR) Attacks on IoT
Replay, Cryptanalysis, Reconnaissance

### Human Machine Interface (HMI) attacks
Gain control of HMI system
Cause physical damage to Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) devices
SCADA vulnerabilities
- Memory corruption
- Lack  of Authorization/Authentication
- Credential management
- Code injection

When systems join or change, there is a weakness
- Like a kink in a knight's armour

## Cloud Attacks
*The cloud is just someone else's computer*

### Cloud vs Physical
Cloud security reduces cost but introduces risk
Redirection risks
Lower detection capability
On premises security increases productivity and availability

### Man in the cloud
Cloud version of man in the middle
Attacker steals victim's sync token and uses it to access files

### Cloud Hopper
Spear-phishing emails with malware to compromise accounts of staff/cloud service firms

### Cloud Cryptojacking
mine crypto on victim's computer
attackers leverage things like cloud misconfigurations, compromised websites, etc.

### Supply Chain Attacks
We don't know who the cloud provider is using for their stuff (Might be outsourcing it)

### Misconfigured AWS S3 bucket setup

### Cryptography

*Code represents a whole thought, Cipher is character by character*

### Brute-force

### Birthday Attack
![](Pasted%20image%2020240917104909.png)
*Getting the right answer the wrong way*

### Side-channel attack

### Don't use hard coded keys (DUHK)
![](Pasted%20image%2020240917105236.png)

### DROWN Attacks
![](Pasted%20image%2020240917105349.png)
Using old encryption systems that people have already found flaws in
