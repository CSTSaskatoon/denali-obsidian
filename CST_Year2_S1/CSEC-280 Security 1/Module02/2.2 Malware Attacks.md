# Malware Attacks
### Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
network attack where attacker gains access to a target network and remains undetected for a long period of time
Main objective is to obtain sensitive information
- Classified documents
- User Credentials
- Personal info
- Network info
- Transaction info
- Credit card info
- Business strategy info
- Control system access info copyright

### Physical Attacks
*Malicious Universal Serial Bus (USB) Cable*
*Card cloning* - Making a duplicate credit card
*Malicious Hard Drive*
*Skimming* - getting payment info off of credit card

### Adversarial Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Introduce malicious traffic into the target ML systems to gain control over the network

*Tainted Training Data for machine learning*
- Infecting/contaminating training data
- Malicious input that disrupt system performance

*Security of Machine learning algorithms*
- Primary task is securing the dataset used for training
	- confidentiality of the data

	- transfer learning attack

### Top 10 application security risks
![](Pasted%20image%2020240912101247.png)

### Injection Flaws
web app vulnerabilities that allow untrusted data to be interpreted and executed
Exploit injection flaws by constructing malicious commands or queries that result in data or loss, corruption, lack of accountability, or denial of access

*SQL Injection*
- Most common
- inject malicious sql queries into user input

*Command injection*
- Inject malicious code

*LDAP Injection*

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks
Exploit vulnerabilities in dynamically generating pages, inject client-side scripts into pages viewed by users
Occurs with unvalidated inputs

### Directory Traversal Attacks
attacks use `../` to access restricted directories
often require trial and error
Send URLs that contain the file name, plus various escape codes to the server

### Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) Attacks
tricks victim into performing action on their behalf
Force user's browser to send malicious requests
*Victim holds an active session with a trusted site and simultaneously visits a malicious site*

### DNS Amplification attack
Takes advantage of the DNS recursive method of DNS redirection
By placing lots of queries, it may overload the server

### Server-side Request forgery
Send crafted requests to the internal/backend servers

### Application Level DoS Attack
Emulate the request syntax a network-level traffic characteristics as that of the legitimate clients which makes it undetectable by existing DoS protection

*Targets*
- CPU, memory, socket
- Disk bandwidth
- database bandwidth
- Worker processes

*Why application are vulnerable to DoS*
- Reasonable use of expectations
- Environment bottlenecks
- Implementation flaws
- Poor data validation

### XML External Entity (XEE) Injection
SSRF when a misconfigured XML parser allows applications to parse XML input from an unreliable source
Refer victims web application to an external entity
Allows attacker to access protected files and services from servers or connected networks

### Watering Hole
Compromise a legitimate website so that the victim gets compromised when they use it

### Man in the browser attack
uses a trojan horse to intercept the calls between the browser and it's security mechanisms/libraries
Works with an already installed Trojan and acts between the browser and it's security mechanisms
Financial deception

### Session Replay Attack
Attacker listens to the conversation between the user and the server and captures the auth token of the user
Once the auth token is captured, the attacker replays the request to the server with the captured auth token and gains access to the server

### Application Programming Interface (API)
- Fuzzing
- Invalid input
- Injection
- Insecure SSL config
- Insecure Direct Object References
- Insecure Session/Auth handling
- Login/credential stuffing
- API DDoS

### Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Stripping
Domoting the website from HTTPS to HTTP
circumvents the security enforced by SSL certificates over HTTPS

### Malicious Code/Script Execution
*PowerShell*
- Living off the land
- fileless malware injected into running applications using a PS script

*Python*
- easy syntax
- download python scripts from open-source platforms

*Bash*
- Employed to download malicious files/programs and run them

*Macros*
*Visual Basic Applications (VBA)*

### Password Cracking
Used to recover passwords from computer systems
Gain unauthorized access
Most are successful because of weak/easily guessed passwords

### Password Attacks
Non-electronic
- Hidden camera, see it in person

Active online
- directly communicate with victims machine

Passive online
- no communicating with the authorizing party

Offline attacks
- Copy the target's password file and crack it on their own system

### Dictionary, Brute-force and rule-based attacks
*Dictionary* - file is loaded into the cracking application and runs against user accounts
*Brute-Force* - Tries every combination of the characters until it's broken
*Rule-based* - This attack is used when the attacker gets some info about the password

### Passphrase
String of words to remember a password 

### Password Guessing
List of all possible passwords from the information collected through social engineering or any other way and manually inputs them
Frequency of attacks is less
Failure rate is high

### Hash injection/pass the hash (PtH)
inject a compromised hash into a local session and use that to validate
Attacker finds and extracts a logged-on domain admin account hash
Attacker uses hash to log onto the domain controller

### Rainbow Table
A precomputed table that contains word lists like dictionary files, brute force lists and their hash values
hash of passwords is captured and compared to hash table. If a match is found, the password gets cracked
it's easy to recover passwords by comparing the captured password hashes to the precomputed tables

### Buffer overflow
Program accepts more data than the allocated buffer
overwrite neighboring memory locations
Inject malicious code, modify program data, access critical information, escalate privileges

### Horizontal and Vertical Escalation
*Horizontal* - Acquiring same privileges but assuming the identity of someone else
*Vertical* - Gaining higher privileges

### DLL Hacking/Injection
DLL files are not commonly ready by antivirus software
- Robber and PowerSploit detect hijackable DLLs

### Driver manipulation
*Application Shimmering*
*refactoring* - modify non-functional code without affecting the actual operation of the driver

### Social Engineering
- Convincing people to reveal confidential information
- Depend on the fact that people are unaware of the valuable information they have access to
- Con artist

#### Common targets
Receptionists/help desk
Tech support Exec
Senior Exec
Vendors
Users/clients
System admins
*Basically anyone but the dead*

### Behaviors vulnerable to attacks
- Authority
- Intimidation
- Consensus or Social proof
- Scarcity
- Urgency
- Familiarity or Liking
- Trust

### Impersonation
attacker pretends to be a legit or authorized user
May impersonate a legitimate or authorized person
Posing as a legit end user - Attacker gives this identity and asks for the sensitive info
Posing as important - attacker poses as a VIP

### Impersonation (Vishing)
attacker tricks individuals to reveal personal and financial info using voice technology
Someone calls the help desk and says he forgot his password.

### Eavesdropping, shoulder surfing, dumpster diving
*Eavesdropping* - unauthorized listening
*Shouldersurfing* - direct observation techniques such as looking over someone's shoulder to get information

### Reverse social engineering, piggy backing and tailgating
*Reverse social engineering* - Attacker presents themselves as an authority to seek help from
*Piggybacking* - Authorized person lets in an unauthorized person
*Tailgating* - Attacker wearing a fake ID badge, enters a secured area by closely following an authorized person

### Phishing
*Number one way to do attacks*
send someone an illegitimate email claiming to be from a legit site in an attempt to aquire user's personal info
Redirect users to fake webpages that mimic trustworthy sites

#### Types of phishing
*Spear Phishing* - targeted phishing attack
*Whaling* - targets high profile personnel
*Pharming* - redirects web traffic to a fraudulent website by installing a malicious program
*Spimming* - a variant of spam that exploits instant messaging platforms

### Credential Harvesting and typosquatting
![700](Pasted%20image%2020240912113800.png)

### Elicitation
Extract info by drawing them into normal and disarming conversations
To use this technique, the attacker needs to create complex cover stories, and may even need to involve co-conspirators

*Flattery*
*Bracketing*
*False Statements*
*Artificial ignorance*
*Sounding board*
