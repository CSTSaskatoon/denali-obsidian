## Module Objectives

## Motives, Goals, and Objectives of Information Security Attacks
![](Pasted%20image%2020240910104332.png)
*Attack = Motive (Goal) + Method + Vulnerability*

### Attack Classifications
*Passive Attacks* - no flags raised, information gathering, googling
*Active Attacks* - Interact with the target, possibly flags raised
*Close-In Attacks* - Physically close
*Insider Attacks* - Privileged access
*Distribution Attacks* - Attackers tamper with hardware or software prior to installation or in transit

### Hacking Definition
Attacking/Cracking is more aggressive
*Exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising security controls*

### EC-Council Hacking Methodology
1. Foot printing and Reconnaissance - passive, information gathering
2. Scanning
3. Enumeration
4. System hacking
5. Maintaining access/Escalation of privilege
6. Clearing tracks
7. Planting backdoors

### Footprinting and Reconnaissance
Should never raise flags
longest phase
- Google
- Satellite search
- Reading the newspaper

### Scanning
May raise some flags, but still relatively quiet
Gathering information
Testing network ports
Information about the systems and network

### Gaining Access
Get into the system at some level, possibly escalate
- Password cracking, buffer overflows, DOS, session hijacking

### Maintaining Access
Attacker tries to retain ownership of the system
Can secure the system with backdoors, rootkits or trojans
Attackers can upload, download and manipulate data, applications and system configurations
Create a user account
Use the system to launch future attacks

### Clearing Tracks
Delete evidence that things on the computer were changed
raises less suspicion

### Cyber Kill Chain methodology
How do you figure out who attacked you?
Know your system and you can defend it better
Adapted for the military
What attack patterns do they follow?
How do they communicate?

### Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
The pattern that groups/hackers use to attack

### MITRE Attack Framework
Knowledge base of attack techniques
![](Pasted%20image%2020240910111428.png)

### Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
Lets you analyze and predict what is going to happen when you get attacked

### Reconnaissance
Should only be passive
Social engineering is a big deal, gets more into scamming than reconnaissance though
Gain network information and structure

### Network Scanning
Getting more active, might alert an admin
Port scanning
Identifying network structure

### DNS Foot printing
Provides information about location and type of servers
Determine key hosts and perform social engineering
DNS interrogation tools lets you retrieve info

### Packet Sniffing
turns the NIC of a system to the promiscuous mode so it listens to all data on it's segment

### Man in the middle
intercept messages
attacker can read, modify, and insert fraudulent data into the intercepted communication
*Cain and Abel*

### DNS Poisoning
manipulate the computer cache or DNS cache to change IP
No record of the cache after it's cleared

### Domain Hijacking
domain ownership is changed to the attacker's server
Attacker tries to infiltrate the domain registrar account using technologies such as phishing or social engineering

### ARP Spoofing
maps the IP to a different MAC address
spam the target machine's ARP cache with the value you want

### DHCP Starvation
Request all of the IP addresses from the DHCP server 
DoS
![](Pasted%20image%2020240910113340.png)

### DHCP Spoofing
Set up rogue DHCP server to respond to requests with wrong IP addresses

### Switch port stealing
similar to ARP poisoning, redirect MAC

### MAC spoofing/duplicating/cloning
MAC is hardware level, but can be spoofed
security should never be based on MAC addresses

### IP Address Spoofing
Put someone else's IP as the source for the packet
only really useful as DoS

### Denial of Service (DoS)
Consume a resource so that things are slow or don't work at all
Overload a server with information/requests so it can't serve the actual users
Only useful for vandalism and disrupting the business

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
coordinated DoS attack using a botnet
hides the attacker

### Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS)
DDoS, plus IP spoofing
