## What is Information Security
Protection of information and resources
- Hardware, software, people

Data has 3 states
- Rest, Transit and use
- Each has their own problems

### Need for security
Ease of use = lower security
Everything is networked now

### Elements of Information Security
**Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authenticity, Non-Repudiation**
Non-repudiation is that you can't deny you did something (Important for the law)

### Security, Functionality and Usability Triangle

**Want to make this triangle smaller**

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
**CVE** - Common Vulnerability Exploit
address security risks to support business operations
**Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover**

**Prevention, Detection and Recovery**
- Everyone focuses on Prevention, but the other two are needed

### Security Challenges
Government Rules/regulations
Lack of qualified and skilled cybersecurity professionals
Difficulty centralizing security in a distributed computing environment
Fragmented and complex privacy and data protection regulations
Compliance issues due to the implementation of BYOD policies in companies
Relocation of sensitive data from legacy data centers to the cloud without proper configuration

### Impact of Information Security Attacks
**Financial Loss, Loss of Confidentiality and integrity, Damaged Customer Relationship, Loss of business Reputation, Legal and compliance issues, operational impacts**

### Essentials of Network Security
*Controls (Solution)*
*Protocols*
*Devices (Can be physical or not)*

### Goals of network defense
Make sure people can't get in
Protect the ogranizations information, systems, etc.

### Information Assurance Principles
**CIA**
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

### Network Defense Benefits

### Challenges
**Distributed Computing Environments**
**Emerging Threats**
**Lack of network security skills**

### Approaches
**Preventative**
**Retrospective**
**Reactive**
**Proactive** - Similar to preventative, expect to be attacked

### Adaptive Strategies
**Protect, Detect, Respond, Predict**

## Security Controls
### Physical Security Controls
**Locks, fences, badges, security Guards, mantrap doors, biometric system, lighting, motion detectors, closed-circuit TVs, Alarms**

### Technical Controls (Networking)
**Protocols, logins, firewalls, etc.**
Software controls

### Technologies
**Architecture, firewalls, IDS (Intrusion Detection System), Antivirus**
Encryption
Separating environments

### Operations
**Technological Implementations aren't good enough, you need policies**
Enforce the policies, because otherwise it's useless
Business continuity, disaster plan

### People and users
Network defense team
Incident handling and response team (IH & R) - recovery
Forensics - retrospective

#### Network defense Team
**Network Admin, Security Admin, engineer, Architect, analyst, technician**

#### Incident Handling and Response Team
**Information Security Officer, Incident Coordinator, Forensic Investigator, Threat Researcher, System Admin, Network Admin, Internal Auditor**

#### Forensics Team
**Photographer, Incident Responder, Incident Analyzer, Evidence Examiner, Evidence Documenter, Evidence Manager, Evidence Witness, Attorney**
