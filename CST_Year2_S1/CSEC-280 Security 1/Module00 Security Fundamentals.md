*Easy/Convenience is the opposite of security*

### Homework
Go to a store and shake magazines to get cards and ship things to Ben's house
### Information Security
- Protection of available information and information resources
- Necessary for a responsible individual or organization to secure confidential information
- Minimize business risk and other consequences of losing crucial data
- Protects sensitive information and unauthorized activities

#### What to protect
- Data
- Hardware/Physical
- People

#### Defense in Depth

You can't just focus on the security from outside the company
Think about internal security as well
- We can't fuck with the Cad Cam network
- Everyone should be taught about security
- Policy govern what you do
- *Thoughts on cybersecurity department doing things like fake phishing emails that you are supposed to identify and report?*

*Even if you get past the first layer of security (Ex. company firewall), you shouldn't have access to everything*

### 3 Main areas of security
**Prevention** - Locked door
**Detection** - Cameras, motion sensors, alarms, etc.
**Recovery** - Repair damage

#### Vulnerabilities
Weakness or a flaw
Can exist in a system or a process

#### Threats
Malicious/negative event that takes advantage of a vulnerability

#### Risk
Potential for loss and damage when the threat occurs
Probability of a harmful event occurring and the damage of that event
*Risk analysis is the basis of security (Likelihood x Consequences = Higher Risk)*

### Security Management Process
Monitoring -> Identification -> Implementation -> Monitoring

#### The CIA Triad
*Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability*
- Integrity is important because if the data is not reliable then who cares if it's confidential and available?
- Having bad data integrity is like having a Carbon Monoxide leak, you might not realize something is wrong until it's too late

### Authentication vs Authorization
- Identification - First step in confirming someone's identity
- Authentication - Enter credentials (username/password)
- Authorization - What access you have to the system once you've logged in
