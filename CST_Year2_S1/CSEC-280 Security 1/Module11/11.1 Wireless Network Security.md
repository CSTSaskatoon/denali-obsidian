## Terminology
GSM - Universal system used for mobile transportation for wireless networks
Bandwidth - Frequency that data can transfer over
Access Point (AP)

## Wireless Technologies
- Association
- Service Set Identifier (SSID)
- OFDM - encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies
- MIMO-OFDM, DSSS, FHSS all block interference

## Wireless Networks
- Radio Frequency (RF)
- Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi)
- Bluetooth
- RFID - uses RF
- WiMAX - long distance wireless network

### Topologies
Ad-Hoc standalone (Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS))
Infrastructure

### Classifications
- WLAN - local
- WPAN - personal
- WWAN - wide
- WMAN - metropolitan

### Components
- Access Point (AP)
- Wireless Cards (NIC)
- Modem
- Bridge
- Repeater
- Router
- Gateways
- USB Adapter
- Antenna
	- Directional
	- Parabolic Grid
	- Dipole
	- Omnidirectional
	- Yagi
	- Reflector

### Wireless Encryption
- 802.11i
- WEP
- LEAP
- EAP
- WPA, 2, 3
- RADIUS
- None are really that secure, issues with legacy infrastructure

### Wi-Fi protected Access (WPA)
temporal key protocol
still not good
WPA2 is ok with RADIUS
WPA3 has fancy encryption and stuff but it still isn't good because the signals can just be grabbed and cracked later

### Auth protocols
- EAP-FAST
- EAP-TLS
- EAP-TTLS
- IEEE802.1X
- Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)

### Security Measures
- get rid of rogue connections on APs
- placement of AP and antenna
- disable SSID broadcasting
- encryption
- have an inventory of devices
- Disable SSID broadcasting
- Change default passwords

### Detect Rogue APs
- Wireless Scanning
- Wired Network scanning
- SNMP Polling
