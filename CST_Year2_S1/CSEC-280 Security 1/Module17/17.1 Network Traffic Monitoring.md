# Network Traffic Monitoring
Retrospective

### Need for Network Monitoring
Even when security tools are in place, attackers can find ways to bypass them
Security tools usually can't detect changing attack patterns since they look for signatures

### Advantages
Understanding data flow

### Signatures
Set of traffic characteristics (source/destination IP, TCP flags, packet length, TTL, etc.)

### Baselines
Accepted behavior for normal network traffic
different between organizations
benchmark to differentiate normal and suspicious traffic
Need to keep it updated

### Categories of Suspicious Signatures
*Informational*
*Reconnaissance*
*Unauthorized Access*
*Denial of Service*

### Attack Signature Analysis Techniques
Content based Signature analysis
- attack signatures contained in packet payloads
- Check for specific strings in payload

Atomic signature based
- Single packet analysis is enough to detect an attack

Context based
- Attack signatures are contained in packet headers
- Inspect headers for suspicious header info such as source/destination IP, IP options, protocols, port numbers, IP fragmentation flags, offset, etc.

Composite signature based
- Multi packet analysis is required to detect signatures

## Monitoring and Analyzing Telnet Traffic
Telnet isn't encrypted
Ideally it should be disabled
