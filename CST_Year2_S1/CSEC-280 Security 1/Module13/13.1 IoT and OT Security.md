# IoT and OT Security
### What is IoT
Internet of Things
Device that has the capability to communicate over the internet

### Why
3 Dimensional plane - Anyone, anything, anytime

### Technologies and Protocols
- Short Range wireless
- Medium Range wireless
- Long range wireless

### Communication Models
- Device to Device
- Device to gateway
- Device to Cloud
- Cloud to Cloud

### IoT Enabled IT Environment
Real time monitoring
basically an immediate response system
analytics

### System Management
- Device Management
- User Management
- Security Management
	- Baseline

### Framework security
- Edge
	- encryption
	- no default passwords
- Gateway
	- encryption
	- auth
- Cloud
	- encryption
	- authentication
- Mobile
	- local storage security
	- account lockout mechanism

### Best Practices
- Disable guest accounts
- use the lock out user feature
- Auth
- Don't want automated systems in business network
- IDS, IPS
- end to end encryption
- VPN architecture
- Security as a unified, integrated system

## Operational Technology (OT)
software/hardware designed to detect or cause changes in industrial operations
Almost all physical

### Terminology
*Assets* - physical assets (hardware) and logical assets (software)
*Zones and Conduits* - network segregation, access control
*Industrial network* - network of automated systems
*Business Network* - network system for the infrastructure of the business
*Industrial Protocols* - serial communication over standard ethernet
*Network Perimeter* - boundary between secure and insecure zones
*Electronic Security Perimeter*
*Critical Infrastructure*

### IT/OT Convergence
Industrial Demilitarized zone (IDMZ) between IT Systems and OT Systems

### Challenges
Legacy systems

### Industrial Control System (ICS)
collection of control systems

*Types*
Distributed Control system - have a redundant system
Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) controls and monitors facilities and infrastructure
Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) - instructions customized to perform tasks
Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) - automated control system to protect manufacturing environment
