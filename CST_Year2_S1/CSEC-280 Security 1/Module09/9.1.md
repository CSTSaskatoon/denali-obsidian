## Secure Applications
It is defined as secure if it *restricts access* to resources, ensures confidentiality, integrity, availability

### Application Security Administration
Protect the users from downloading/installing malicious application
Prevent applications from modifying executables
Prevent the applications from accessing, creating, modifying OS resources unnecessarily

### Application Security Frame
Input Validation
Data protection
Authorization

### 3 W's in Application Security
Who, What, Why
Why should we care Popular target What do we need Constant security vigilance at various cycles of development Who is responsible Manager, architects, developers, testers and administrators
*Making an application secure and making it usable are two opposite things*

### Secure Application Design/Architecture
Designing the app to be secure from the start
Can save you money
protect potential flaws early on in development
Might make business functionality harder (app won't work right)

### Goals of the Secure Design Process
Identifying
Designing
Enforcing

### Security Requirement Specifications
Non-functional requirements
impede on the function of the application
stakeholders might overlook the security aspect of the application
negligence can lead to the app being vulnerable
Gathering security requirements should be part of the strategic application development

### Secure Design Principles
Guidelines, best practices that devs should be forced to follow (policies)
common vulnerabilities - Defense in Depth, Security through obscurity, reduction of attack surface, fault tolerance

### Threat Modeling
Know what the attackers can do
Model your application to stop it
Starts in the design phase
output is exposing all possible threats on the application
- often rated so you know how bad it is

### Design Secure Application Architecture
Web, Application, Database
Security on one isn't enough (Defense in depth)
includes input validation, database abstraction, server proxies, application firewalls, etc.
Encrypt all layers of communication

### Secure coding Practices
*Input validation* - verifying user input
- can screen out 95% of attacks if done right

*Parameterized Queries*
- SQL query is written without embedding parameters
- Stored on the application

*Parameterized Stored Procedures*
- Stored in the database, called by the application

*Unicode Normalization*
- normalizing strings and determining if they are the same
- input validation applied after normalization
- protects against cross site scripting

*Output Encoding*
- convert special characters into a special format so they are no longer vulnerable

*Error/Exception Handling*
- Stop everything when you get an error
- if you break into a car and it just stops working after a minute, good luck getting away

*Secure Session Cookies*
- generate random session IDs
- strong encryption
- cookie auth credentials should be associated with an IP

*Secure Response Headers*
- HSTS
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Cache Control

*Obfuscation/Camouflage*
- modifying application code

*Code Signing*
- Signature ensures integrity and authenticity of an application or software upon install and execution on a system

### Software Security Framework
*Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)*
- Specific threats to an organization

*Building Security In Maturity (BSIMM)*
- general threats in the community the organization is part of

### Resilience and Automated Strategies
doesn't matter when you get hit, it matters if you get up or not
*Continuous Integration*
- Frequent inspection of tasks

*Continuous Delivery*
- Automated tests

*Continuous Development*
- simplifies integration

*Continuous Monitoring*

# Security Testing
### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
Secure code review
identify security related weaknesses in code
when it's not released to the public yet

#### Automatic (SCA)
analysis tool to scan code and report potential flaws

#### Manual (By other testers)
go through your code line by line

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
simulating security attacks
fuzzing application inputs

#### SAST vs DAST
SAST is whitebox, requires sourcecode, finds vulnerabilities faster
- Test application on outside
- Done by Pen testers
- Pre-Production or during Production
- Scanners at payloads transfers

DAST is blackbox, requires running application
- Running application
- Found at the end of cycle so more expensive to change

### Fuzz Testing
Black box
identify coding errors
random data generated

### Whitelisting
list of something that's allowed (could be users, applications, IP, etc.)

### Blacklisting
list of something that's banned/bad actors
automatically allows access to other applications
Commonly implemented by spam filters, antivirus, etc. 
can do it windows via Path, Hash, Zone, Certificate

### `ManageEngine` Desktop Central for Application Blacklisting
can automatically detect and remove applications

### Sandboxxing
execute untrusted/untested programs
extra layer of security
protects the system form harmful programs

*Isolation or Rule based (software)*
- Isolation is basically a VM
- Rule based is based on GP, still uses system resources

*hardware*
- most secure

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)
deployed via proxy in front of web application
`URLScan` is an example, helps with SQL injection, cross site scripting, XSS, etc.

### Bug Bounty Programs
pay people who find exploits
