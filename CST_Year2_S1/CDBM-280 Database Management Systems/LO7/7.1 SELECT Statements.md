## `SELECT` Statements
Used to query the database
The result is simply another table (dynamically created from the database)

### Simplest Syntax
`SELECT * FROM tableName;` - *`*`* selects all columns in order

### Specifying columns
*`SELECT expression [, expression, ...] FROM tableName;`*
Expression can be column name (most common), constant, `*`, function or calculation
Can specify all columns, some of them, or a mix various expressions
Can also give expressions an alias by using the **`AS`** keyword
- This is a good practice to make things more readable

### Full Syntax
```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT | All] expression_list
	FROM the table(s) involved
	[WHERE searchCondition]
	[GROUP BY group_list
	[HAVING group_search_condition]]
	[ORDER BY orderList];
```

### Operators
*Math Operators* - `*,/,-,+`
*String Concatenation* - `||`
*Relational Operators* - `<,>, <=, >=, <>, !=, =`
- `<>` and `!=` are both Not Equals
- Can be used with string values - The evaluation is based on the ASCII table (`S > s`, case sensitive, convert to upper or lowercase for case insensitivity)

*Boolean Operators* - `AND, OR, NOT`, couple other ones that are 'stupid' according to Jason
*Ranger Operator* - `columnName BETWEEN low AND high`
- Inclusive
- Equivalent to `columnName >= low AND column <= high`
- Both are valid, `BETWEEN` is just more readable

*Comparison Operators*
- `columnName IN (constant [, constant, ...]`
- `columnName NOT IN (constant [, constant, ...]`
	- Return true/false if the column value is in the list of constraints
- `columnName LIKE pattern`
	- Checks for a pattern, using wild cards
	- `%` - any 0 or more characters
	- `_` - any 1 character

*Null Comparison Operators*
- Can't test for null using equality/inequality
	- `column IS NULL`
	- `column IS NOT NULL`

### Sorting
uses the `ORDER BY` clause
Only affects the display order of the results from the query
Can order on multiple columns
Default is ascending order (`ASC`), can use `DESC` for descending
Nulls appear first in ascending and last in descending

## Functions
### Single Row Number Functions
- `ABS`
- `CEIL`
- `FLOOR`
- `MOD`
- `POWER`
- `ROUND`
- `TRUNC`

### Single Row Character Functions
- `CONCAT`
- `REPLACE`
- `SUBSTR`
- `UPPER | LOWER`

### Single Row Date Functions
- `ADD_MONTHS`
- `LAST_DAY`
- `MONTHS_BETWEEN`

### Conversion Functions
Convert from one type to another
`TO_NUMBER(string [, format])` - changes string value to a number, should only use if you know it will work
`TO_CHAR(date, format or number, format)` - Converts a date/time into a string in a certain format
`TO_DATE(string, format)` - converts string into a date
Date and time input mask elements
- `dd` - numeric date
- `mon` - 3 letter month
- `month` - full month name
- `yy` - 2 digit year
- `yyyy` - 4 digit year
- `hh` - hours
- `mi` - minutes
- `ss` - seconds
- `am` - am or pm

Number mask elements
- `9` - optional digit
- `0` - required digit
- `$` - dollar sign
- `,` - thousand separator
- `.` - decimal point

### Functions for Dealing with Nulls
We want to *make the null mean something* (replace it with a meaningful value, Ex. replace Null with 0)
`NVL(val1, val2)` - Evaluates `val1`, and if it's null, returns `val2`. Else, return `val1` (Oracle specific)
`COALESCE(val1, val2 [, val3, val4, ...])` - Returns the first non-null value (ANSI standard version)

### Misc Functions
`USER` - Returns the currently logged in user

## Group/Aggregate Functions
Group = Aggregate = Summary
Return a single row result based on groups of rows rather than single rows.
These functions apply to a group of rows, and each group will get a single value. (sometimes called a summary row)
**Can't mix group row results and single row results**
- Perhaps using a reporting tool or similar it is possible to show individual and group rows

Takes in an expression (most of the time a column name, but could be a calculation)
`DISTINCT` can be included as part of the parameter expressions (only distinct and and not repeat values will be used in the function)
**Can't be used as conditions in the `WHERE` clause**
Aggregates and nulls
- if there are any null values in the column on which the aggregate function is operating they are ignored by the function
- `COUNT(*)` - counts each row including null values
- Can use `NVL` or `COALESCE` to include nulls by substituting it for another value

Functions are
- `SUM` - Provides a total
- `AVG` - provides an average (nulls are ignored, might result in a different average than expected)
- `COUNT(expression)` - counts the non-null values (can include `DISTINCT`, `NVL`)
- `COUNT(*)` - Counts all members, doesn't care about data values, most common use
- `MIN/MAX` - Provides lowest/highest value, ignoring nulls

Aggregate function results may be passed into another aggregate function
- Ex. `MAX(COUNT(*))` - assuming a group by in later statement, would count each group and then find the max
- When doing this in this fashion you can't display expressions even if they are in the group by

### `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses
Access did this for us
Without `GROUP BY`, it just makes one giant group for the whole table
Each group gets a summary row
- aggregate operates on each group instead of the whole table
- Can show the value you grouped by in the clause (Ex. `customer`), but not other values (Ex. `orderNumber`)

`GROUP BY` clause
- specify if you want the database to group the selected rows based on each value of expression(s) for each row and return a single summary row for each group
- Expressions can appear in the `SELECT` list (don't have to, but typically include at least 1)
- Aliases don't work
- The expressions are evaluated as combinations, so every unique combination of values will get a group
- If the grouping column contains more than 1 null, all of them are put into a single group (**NULLs get their own group**)

`HAVING` clause
- placed after the `GROUP BY`
- Restrict groups that are already formed based on aggregate functions (Most often `SUM` or `COUNT`)
- Like `WHERE` but for groups
- `HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;`
- If you have basic expressions like `cust <> 'A'` do them in a `WHERE` clause instead because having groups is expensive
