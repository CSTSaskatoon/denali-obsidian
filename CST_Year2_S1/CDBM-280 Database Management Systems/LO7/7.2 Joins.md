## Joining Tables
With normalization, we break related information into multiple tables. Joins put the tables back together
We will use the *ANSI standard Join syntax (`ON`)*

General rules
- The columns must have "related meaning" - **don't** join by age and quantity, or city and last name, etc.
- Normally join on the primary key and foreign key columns
- All tables must be listed in order for the system to perform the join. Each joined table joined successively must have a matching table in the group to join to.

Syntax
- `SELECT expression(s)`
- `FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON condition [JOIN table3 ON condition ...];`

Join Operator
- Usually *equality* (matches), but can be any relation operator `table1.ID = table2.FK`
- Join columns do not need to be displayed in the expression list
- ERDs will help you figure out what join conditions are necessary

### Types of Joins

*Inner* is the most common
- default if you don't specify the type
- Returns matching records between the tables
- `SELECT <select_list> FROM TableA A INNER JOIN TableB B ON A.Key = B.Key`

*Cross* is a cross product or cartesian join
- All the possible combinations from each table
- Normally not something that's useful

*Outer*
- data can be lost when doing an inner join that can be "regained" using an outer join
- **`LEFT`** includes all rows from the first (left) table of the join including rows that don't match
- **`RIGHT`** is the same as left, but for the second (right) table of the join
- `SELECT <select_list> FROM TableA A LEFT JOIN TableB ON A.Key = B.Key`
- `SELECT <select_list> FROM TableA A LEFT JOIN TableB ON A.Key = B.Key WHERE B.Key IS NULL`
	- Exclusive left join, only includes records that **DON'T** have matches in `TableA`

*Full*
- Includes all rows from both tables and all matching rows between the two tables
- `SELECT <select_list> FROM TableA A FULL OUTER JOIN TableB B ON A.Key = B.Key`
- `OUTER` keyword technically not required
- `SELECT <select_list> FROM TableA FULL OUTER JOIN TableB ON A.Key = B.Key WHERE A.Key IS NULL OR B.Key IS NULL`
	- Exclusive full join, only includes records that don't have any matches on both sides

*Self* is joining a table to itself
- Table has to appear more than once in the FROM clause
- At least one of the tables must be given an alias so that we can distinguish between instances
- Overall follows the same rules as other joins (can do outer joins, etc.)

## Set Operators
Result Set - What is displayed after you make a query

*Rules*
- Result Sets must all have the same number of columns
- Corresponding columns must have compatible types
- `ORDER BY` has to go at the very end
- Aliases/column names from the first query will be used in the result

### `UNION`
- `UNION` adds two (or more) different result sets, basically stacking them on top of each other and then performing `DISTINCT`
- `SELECT ... UNION [ALL] SELECT ...;` - `ALL` prevents it from performing distinct

### `INTERSECT`
Display only rows in common between two (or more) result sets.
Same general rules as `UNION`

### `MINUS`
Displays the rows in the first query that aren't in the second
