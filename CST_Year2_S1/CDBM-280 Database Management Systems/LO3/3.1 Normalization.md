## Bad
Dates inconsistently formatted
Locations sometimes have street locations, some just a town name
Category not consistent
Reader has single characters sometimes
Reading doesn't have consistent accuracy or units
Type has "upper", "lower", "High" and "low" which likely mean the same thing

## Good
There are no null values
it's still human-readable

# Notes
### Modifying table data
what problems would arise by deleting, adding or editing data from this table?
![](Pasted%20image%2020240923111931.png)
Inconsistencies if instructor or course changes name
If you change Rob to not teach Math282 you wouldn't have any data on them

### Tables vs Relations
![](Pasted%20image%2020240923112410.png)

### Characters of a Relation
A relation is a two dimensional table that has
- rows contain data about an entity
- Columns contain data about attributes of the entity
- Cells of the table hold a single value
- All entries in the column are the same kind
- Each column has a unique name
- The order of the columns is unimportant
- No two rows may be identical

### Terms
![](Pasted%20image%2020240923112817.png)

### Functional Dependencies
- Relations store instances of functional dependencies
- Functional dependency exists when the value of one or more attributes determines the value of other attributes
- Functional dependency holds for the whole relation, not just one instance
- Dependency diagrams are a visual representation
- *A -> B, C*
- *custID -> custName, custAddr*
- *(A, B) -> C, D, E*

#### Example
![](Pasted%20image%2020240923113406.png)
Channel# -> Name
Channel# -> Language
Channel# -> (Name, Language)

### Composite FDs
Composite group can occur on either side of a FD
A grade in a course is detemined by student and course
- *(StudentID, CourseID) -> Grade*

If (A, B) -> C, then niether A nor B will detemine C by itself
if A -> (B, C), then it is true that A -> B and A -> C

### Finding FDs
![](Pasted%20image%2020240923114157.png)
(OrderNumber, SKU) -> (Quantity, Price, Extended Price)
SKU -> Price
(Price, Quantity) -> Extended Price

#### Example
![](Pasted%20image%2020240923114804.png)

(CourseID) -> (courseName, credits)
(studentID, courseID) -> (mark)
(studentID) -> (stuName, stuAddress)

### Candidate Keys
![](Pasted%20image%2020240924092629.png)

*SKU* is the best option here because it's the most unique

### The purpose of Normalization
- Prevent update anomalies and data inconsistencies
- Principles which one should try to achieve in design
- Denormalization may be required for performance reasons
- Relations are categorized into normal forms, according to the types of problems they have

### Modification Anomalies
**Occur when changing the data creates undesirable consequences**
- Deletion
- Insertion
- Update

#### Deletion Anomaly
Occurs when you delete a tupel and it not only deletes the facts that you wanted, but also deletes another piece of data
**`EquipmentRepair(ItemNumber, RepairNumber, Type, AcquisitionCost, RepairDate, RepairAmount)`**
Ex. Delete repair # 2100
![](Pasted%20image%2020240924093230.png)

This relation stores a list of all activities offered, (and it's associated fee) and the students taking them
- SID -> Activity
- Activity -> Fee

Activity(SID, Activity, Fee)
![400](Pasted%20image%2020240924093430.png)

#### Insertion Anomaly
Cannot insert a fact about one entity until we have an additional fact about another entity
**`EquipmentRepair(ItemNumber, RepairNumber, Type, AcquisitionCost, RepairDate, RepairAmount)`**
Ex. Add a new item to the table - ItemNumber (400) for a Drill bit that's acquisition cost is $67.00
![](Pasted%20image%2020240924093725.png)

#### Update Anomaly
Same information can be expressed on multiple rows, therefore update to the table may result in logical inconsistencies
Ex. There are two acquisition costs for the Drill Press
![](Pasted%20image%2020240924094013.png)

#### Fixing Anomalies
![500](Pasted%20image%2020240924093910.png)

### Referential Integrity Constraints
Suppose activities can exist before any student enrolls in the, but no student can enroll in an activity that doesn't have a fee assigned to it
We must check to make sure the activity is present in the ACT-COST table before we can add it to the STU-ACT table
![](Pasted%20image%2020240924094222.png)

### Essence of the Normalization Process
- Every normalized relation should have a single theme
- Any relation having two or more themes should be broken into two or more relations each having a single theme
- When you break up a relation you need to check for and record any resulting referential integrity constraints

## Normal Forms
**Exam will have questions like "what normal form is this violating"**
**2NF violations happen when you have a many-to-many relationship represented in a single table, 3NF violations happen when you have a collection of fields that should become their own table**
![](Pasted%20image%2020240926095132.png)

### 1st Normal Form
must meet all the requirements of a relation
Deals with the "shape" of a record type
All occurrence of a record type must contain the same number of fields.
Relational Database Theory does not deal with records having a variable number of fields

**Requirements of a relation**
![500](Pasted%20image%2020240924095025.png)

### Unnormalized Table
![](Pasted%20image%2020240926080340.png)

#### Relation
![](Pasted%20image%2020240926080425.png)

### 2nd And 3rd Normal Forms
*Deals with the relationship between non-key and key fields*

#### 2nd Normal Form
Must be in 1st NF and every non-key attribute is fully dependent on the full key, not just part of it
Designed to eliminate dependencies that only require part of the key
Violated when a non-key field is determined by only part of the key
**Not relevant if the Primary Key is not Composite**

##### Example
PartInformation (Part(PK), Warehouse(PK), Qty, WHAddress)
(Part(PK), Warehouse(PK)) -> Qty
WH -> WHAddress

PartInformation (Part(PK), Warehouse(PK), Qty)
WH (WH(PK), WHAddress)

##### Example 2
OrderItem (Item#(PK), PO#(PK), ItemDesc, UnitOfMeasure, Qty, Cost)
(Item#) -> (ItemDesc, UnitOfMeasure, Cost)
(PO#, Item#) -> (Qty)

Item (Item#(PK), ItemDesc, UOM, Cost)
OrderItem (Item#(FK, PK), PO#(PK), Qty)

#### 3rd Normal Form
Table must be in 2NF, and every non-key attribute has no transitive dependencies
- **Key attribute makes up a non-key attribute, which in turn makes another non-key attribute**

Move non-key determinant and it's dependent attributes to a new table and form the relationship
The Relation (A(PK), B, C, D) where A -> B, C, D and C -> D becomes Relation1 (A,B,C) 

##### Example 1
![300](Pasted%20image%2020240926083251.png)
![500](Pasted%20image%2020240926083407.png)

##### Example 2
PurchaseOrder (PO#(PK), orderDate, vendor#, vendorName, vendorAddr, shipDate)
PO# -> orderDate, shipDate, vendor#
vendor# -> vendorName, vendorAddr

### Example
EmpInfo (empID(PK), empName, empPhone, deptName, deptPhone, deptManager, skillID, skillName, skillDate, skillLvl)
empID -> empName, empPhone, deptName **2NF Violation**
deptName -> deptPhone, deptManager **3NF Violation**
skillID -> skillName **2NF Violation**
(empID, skillID) -> skillDate, skillLvl

Employee (empID(PK), empName, empPhone, deptName(FK))
Department (deptName(PK), deptPhone, deptManager)
Skill (skillID(PK), skillName)
EmpSkill (empID(FK, PK), skillID(FK, PK), skillDate, skillLvl)

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form
*Must be in 3NF and every determinant is a candidate key*
a 3NF table which does not have multiple overlapping candidate keys will always pass this NF

Covers 2 special cases not covered by 3NF
- part of a key determines part of a key
- non-key attribute determines part of a key

Only possible if there are multiple composite, candidate keys.
![](Pasted%20image%2020241001083820.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020241001084037.png)

### Postal Codes Example
https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/cpc/en/tools/find-a-postal-code.page
postalCode -> streetName, city, prov
(postalCode, houseNo) -> streetName, city, prov
(streetName, city, prov) -> postalCode

![500](Pasted%20image%2020241001090237.png)

### 4/5 Normal Form
*Multivalued facts/dependencies* - a condition in a relation with 3 or more attributes in which independent attributes appear to have relationships they don't have.

#### 4th Normal Form
*Must be in BCNF*
Multivalue dependency exists when a relation has at least 3 attriutes, 2 of them are multi-valued and their value depends only on the third
Designed to eliminate sets of mult-valued dependencies attribute

##### Example 1
![](Pasted%20image%2020241001091121.png)

*Fixed*
![](Pasted%20image%2020241001091355.png)

##### Example 2
Each color for each car is paired with each engine size for each car (and vice versa)
For every car and all of it's possible colors will be paired with all of it's possible engines
![](Pasted%20image%2020241001091623.png)

*Fixed*
![](Pasted%20image%2020241001092026.png)

With this table structure you can still determine, for example, that a red Mustang can have either an F3.2L or F4.5L engine. When you delete one piece of information (i.e., a car colour), you lose only that fact.

#### 5th Normal Form
Also known as *Projection Normal Form (PJNF)*
Deals with cases where information can be reconstructed from smaller pieces of information which can be maintained with less redundancy
Eliminate cyclic dependencies
Generalizes cases not covered by others

##### Example 1
Agents represents companies, companies make products, agents sell products
- Want to a keep a record of which agent sells which product for which company
- Could be keep in one record type with 3 fields

![500](Pasted%20image%2020241001092620.png)

Suppose if an agent sells a certain product, and he represents the company making the product, then he sells that product for that company
![500](Pasted%20image%2020241001092723.png)
*Symmetric constraint*
![](Pasted%20image%2020241001093056.png)

5NF doesn't differ from 4NF unless there exists a *symmetric constraint*, in the absence of this a 4NF record is always a 5NF record

### Domain Key Normal Form
**Constraint** - a rule about governing static values of attributes that is precise enough so that we can ascertain whether the rule is true or not
**Key** - unique identifier of a row
**Domain** - named set of possible attributes
**Domain Key NF** - Every constraint on the relation is a logical consequence of the definition of keys and domains. Informally, a relation is in DKNF if enforcing key and domain restrictions causes all of the constraints to be met

There should be no modification anomalies
More of a conceptual state as opposed to a transformation itself

### De-Normalizing Relations
An overly normalized database may have many small tables
To combine the information from many tables involves a lot of extra overhead
There may be circumstances where you want to denormalize a table
- The decision to store postal code with the address - SIAST doesn't split out the postal code, but a mail order company may find it's important to have accurate addresses over the decrease in performance

Normalization = Good for transaction (CRUD)
Denormalization = Good for queries (Fast, don't have to do joins)
