## DML Statements
- Used to retrieve, add, modify and delete from tables.
- `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT` (LO7)

### Adding Data
- `INSERT INTO tableName [(col1, col2, ...)] VALUES (col1Val, col2Val, ...)`
- Can insert multiple records by using a special kind of `SELECT`
- The two lists must correspond (name to value)
- If the column list is omitted the values section must be in the "natural order" of the columns in the table - *easy to make a mistake*

### Saving and Undoing Changes
**`COMMIT`** - Saves changes since the last commit, often automatically happens on disconnection. A DDL statement like `CREATE` forces an implicit commit
**`ROLLBACK`** - Deletes/undoes any changes since last commit

### Modifying Data
**`UPDATE`**
- `UPDATE tableName SET col1 = newValue [, col2 = newValue, ...] [WHERE condition];`
- The `newValue` can be an expression that performs math or calls functions, but is often literal
- If the `WHERE` section is omitted, all rows in the table are affected. In practice the `WHERE` condition is often the PK (Ex. `WHERE PKcol = someValue`)

### Deleting Data
**`DELETE`**
- `DELETE FROM tableName [WHERE condition];`
- If you leave out the `WHERE`, all rows in the table will be removed

### Advanced Insert using `SELECT` and `CREATE`
Can use a `SELECT` statement to insert multiple rows. Often used to copy data from one table to another, perhaps to create a "snapshot" in time.
Two Syntaxes
- `CREATE`, then `INSERT` with `SELECT`
	- `CREATE` a table as normal
	- `INSERT INTO tableName SELECT ...;`
	- The `SELECT` statement results will be added to the table instead of displayed
- `CREATE` with `SELECT`
	- `CREATE TABLE tableName AS SELECT ...;`
	- The `SELECT` statement results are used to create the table, including field names and datatypes

### Sequences for Creating "AutoNumber" fields
- Sequence is a sequential list of numbers Oracles generates for surrogate key values
- No such thing as an auto number in Oracle
- `CREATE SEQUENCE sequenceName`
	- `[INCREMENT BY number]` - How it will count (default is 1)
	- `[START WTIH start]` - Can be positive or negative, defaults to 1
	- `[MAXVALUE max]` - Highest value possible, by default will stop when reached
	- `[MAXVALUE min]` - Same as above, but smallest
	- `[CYCLE]` or `[NOCYCLE]` - Will cause a return to min value when max is reached, or vice versa (Primary keys you would want `NOCYCLE`)
	- `[CACHE numValues]` or `[NOCACHE]` - Values to store for use, can improve performance when simultaneous users
	- `[ORDER]` - Granting sequence values in order chronologically

#### Using a Sequence
- There are two "pseudo-columns" called `CURVAL` and `NEXTVAL`
- `CURVAL` - Most recent sequence value retrieved during the current user session (specific to each user)
- `NEXTVAL` - moves forward and provides the following value
- To apply to a column in an Insert:
	- `INSERT INTO tableName VALUES (sequenceName.NEXTVAL, some other data...);`
- Not uncommon to have one sequence called "IDs" or something that is used for every table
