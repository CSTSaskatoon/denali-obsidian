Functions are similar to procedures, but they must always return a value.
Generally operations in a function are simply calculating a result to return, rather than performing a number of tasks
```SQL
CREATE [OR REPLACE] FUNCTION [Parameters]
	RETURN return_datatype
IS
	-- Declaration Section
BEGIN
	-- Execution section
EXCEPTION
	-- Exception section
END;
```

### Tips/Rules
1. Return datatype can be any oracle data type
2. Parameters are stored in the same way as procedures
3. The execution sections should both return a value

## How to execute a PL/SQL Function?
*Assign result to a variable*
```sql
employee_name := employer_details_func;
```
if `employee_name` is a datatype varchar we can store the name of the employee by assigning the return type function to it
