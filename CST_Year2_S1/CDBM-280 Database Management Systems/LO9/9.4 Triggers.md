A PL/SQL Block that is triggered to fire automatically when an associate DML state is executed
Can also be triggered as a result of a DDL, but we are only focusing on DML triggers

Reasons to use them
- Enforce business rules that can't be defined with integrity constraints
- Maintain security rules
- Automatically generate values for derived columns
- Prevent Invalid transactions
- Provide value auditing (many systems have built in auditing, but it's often complex and if all we want to track is something simple that changes triggers make it easy)

### Types
*Row Level Trigger*
- Event is triggered for each row changed 
- Ex. `DELETE` 10 rows would trigger 10 times

*Statement Level Trigger*
- Event is triggered for the statement as a whole

### Syntax
```sql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
	{BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF }
	{INSERT [OR] | UPDATE [OR] | DELETE }
	{ OF col_name }
	ON table_name
	[REFERENCING OLD AS o NEW AS n]
	[FOR EACH ROW]
	WHEN (condition)

DECLARE

BEGIN
	-- SQL Statements

END;
```
`INSTEAD OF` is only used for views
- Lets you get around certain views being read only?
- `BEFORE` and `AFTER` can't be used on a view

`OLD` and `NEW`
- By default you can reference the values as `:old.column_name` or `:new.column_name`
- Reference names can be changed from old/new to any other user-defined name
- `OLD` can't be used in `INSERT` triggers
- `NEW` can't be used in `DELETE` triggers
- Both can be used in `UPDATE` triggers

`FOR EACH ROW` makes it a *row level trigger*

### Execution Hierarchy
Only matters if you have multiple triggers on the same table of the same type
- Ex. `UPDATE` triggers on the `Author` table

`BEFORE` statement trigger fires first
`BEFORE` row level trigger happens once for each row affected (alternating with #3)
`AFTER` row level trigger happens, once for each row affected (alternating with #2)
`AFTER` statement trigger fires last

### Information About Existing Triggers
*Data Dictionary* - Read only set of tables that provides info about the database
- Can use views of this to obtain info about triggers
- `DBA_TRIGGERS` - All triggers
- `ALL_TRIGGERS` - All triggers current user can see
- `USER_TRIGGERS` - all triggers owned by the current user

```sql
DESC USER_TRIGGERS:
```

This view stores info about header and body of the trigger
```sql
SELECT * FROM USER_TRIGGERS WHERE trigger_name = 'Before Update Stat_product';
```

You can drop a trigger with
```sql
DROP TRIGGER trigger_name;
```

## Cyclic Cascading Triggers
More than one trigger enters an infinite loop

Example
Given two tables, `abc` and `xyz`, two triggers are created
- `INSERT` trigger
