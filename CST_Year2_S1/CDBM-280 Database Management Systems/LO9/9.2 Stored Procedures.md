*Save code you've written in the database, and then call them whenever you want*

Anonymous Blocks
- What we have been using
- not given names, not stored in the database

Named Blocks
- Stored in the database, given a name, referenced by that name later on

### Types of Named Blocks
- Stored Procedures
- Functions
- Triggers

### Stored Procedures
A named PL/SQL Block which performs one or more tasks
Similar to a procedure (or method in CS)
it can take in parameters, but doesn't return a value (always void)
like an anonymous block, but is saved for repeated usage

#### Parameters
*IN*
- Most common
- Can be referenced by the procedure but can't change it
- default

*OUT*
- The parameter can't be referenced by the value but can be overwritten

*IN OUT*
- pass by reference
- Can both be referenced and overwritten

#### Syntax
```sql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE proc_name [ (list of parameters)]
IS
	-- Declaration section
BEGIN
	-- Execution section
EXCEPTION
	-- Exception section
END;
```
So if we have a procedure that we are passing in variables, it might look like
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedureName
(name_in IN VARCHAR2, name_out OUT VARCHAR2, name_in_out IN OUT VARCHAR2)
IS
```

#### Execution
Two ways
From the script window in SQL Developer
```SQL
EXECUTE [or EXEC] procedureName;
```

Or with another procedure/block (just use the procedure name)
```sql
procedureName;
```
