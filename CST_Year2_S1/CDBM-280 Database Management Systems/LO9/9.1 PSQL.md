### Records
Datatype
Represent a row in a table
Composite types - combination of various other data types (`VARCHAR`, `NUMBER`, etc.)
User Defined

#### Declaring
```sql
TYPE record_type_name IS RECORD
	(first_col_name column_datatype[, second_col_name column_datatype, ... ]);
```
To base the record on a table existing in your database
```sql
col_name table_name.column_name%type;
```

#### Example
```sql
DECLARE
	TYPE employee_type IS RECORD
		(employee_id NUMBER(5),
		employee_first_name VARCHAR2(25),
		employee_last_name employee.last_name%type,
		employee_dept employee.dept%type,
		employee_salary employee.salary%type);

employee_rec employee_type

-- In practice, this is used a lot more
record_name table_name%ROWTYPE;
-- Ex.
employee_rec employee%ROWTYPE;
```

#### Advantages of `ROWTYPE`
Don't have to explicitly declare all fields
If the table changes, it will theoretically still work

#### Disadvantages of `ROWTYPE`
Don't have control over the structure (will have fields in it you don't use)

#### Passing values to/from a Record
```sql
record_name.col_name := value;
```
Can also do it with `SELECT`
```sql
SELECT col1, col2
	INTO record_name.col_name1, record_name.col_name2
	FROM table_name
	[WHERE clause];
```
To retrieve a value from the record and place it into another variable
```sql

```

**A record can only have on row of data selected into it (Use a `WHERE` clause)**

### Cursors
Temporary work area in memory when SQL statement is executed
Contains information on a statement and the rows of data accessed by it
Can hold more than one row, but can only process one row at a time
set of rows is called the *Active Set*

#### Implicit
Created by default when DML statements are executed
Created when a `SELECT` statement that returns just one row is executed
Program has no control over this

#### Explicit
Just an example of what it would look like as a CS enumerator
```cs
int price_in = 30; // Could be some other generated value
someDataStructure = someDataStructure.map((item) => item.price > price_in)
Cursor cursor = someDataStructure.Enumerate();
Record title_rec;

cursor.Open();

// Not sure if this is actually how this would work
while (cursor.Found())
{
	title_rec = cursor.Fetch();
	Console.WriteLine($"{title_rec.title} {title_rec.price}")
}
cursor.Close();
```
What it looks like in SQL
```sql
DECLARE
    -- copy title table row type
    title_rec title%ROWTYPE;
    -- Declare a cursor taht will get the expensive books
    CURSOR title_cur (price_in) IS
        SELECT * FROM Title WHERE price > price_in; -- query isn't executed yet

BEGIN
    -- CURSOR select query is run on Open
    OPEN title_cur(&EnterANumber); -- Note IF you know you will GET exactly one ROW, it's easier IF you just SELECT INTO a RECORD
    LOOP
        EXIT WHEN title_cur%NOTFOUND;
    
        FETCH title_cu INTO title_rec;
    
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(title_rec.title || ' ' || title_rec.price);
        
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE title_cur; -- END processing ON CURSOR/ RELEASE resources
    
END;
```

#### For Loop Version
With CS
```cs
int price_in = 30;
someDataStructure = someDataStructure.map((item) => item.price > price_in)
Cursor cursor = someDataStructure.Enumerate();

foreach (Record title_rec in cursor)
{
	Console.WriteLine($"{title_rec.title} {title_rec.price} {title_cur.Count}")
}
```
SQL
```sql
DECLARE
    CURSOR title_cur (price_in NUMBER) IS
        SELECT * FROM Title WHERE price > price_in;

BEGIN
    FOR title_rec IN title_cur(&Enter_A_Number) LOOP
        -- Print out the information about row
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(title_rec.title || ' ' || title_rec.price || ' ' || title_cur%ROWCOUNT);
        
    END LOOP;
    
END;
```
