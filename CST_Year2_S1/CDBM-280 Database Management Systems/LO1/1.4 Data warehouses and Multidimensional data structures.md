## Data warehouse
### [Youtube Video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=zTs5zjSXnvs)
Not in 3NF (Third Normal Form or Big Data)
Should be normalized to 2NF
This means you get Data redundancy, storage and can get data quicker
The purpose is to provide aggregate data which is in a suitable format for decision making

#### ETL and data marts
Extraction - Get the data
Transformation - make it useful (same format)
Loading - Save it to the warehouse

##### Data Marts (Sub sets of the DW)
Don't mess with my data
Keep it simple for the user
Small problems are easier to solve
### More Notes
*Data warehouse* (*DW*) - A database used for reporting and data analysis to assist in decision making. Usually data archives and taken from various enterprise application systems.

#### A data warehouse tends to be
*Subject Oriented*
- Organized around subjects (customers, products, sales) instead of major functional areas (invoicing, stock control, product sales)

*Integrated*
- Integrating Multiple data sources to be consistent

*Time Variant*
- Data represents a series of snapshots that is only valid to some point in time

*Non-volatile*
- Data is not added in real time but instead refreshed on a regular basis
- Data is added as a supplement and does **NOT** replace old data

#### Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) Process
- Extracts the data from various operational systems
- Transform the data to fit operational needs (2NF, Consistency, etc.)
- Loads the data warehouse/data marts

These pieces of information are then stored in the Marts (Data and Strategic).Â  Marts are used to **improve performance** and **ease of use within** that specific area. They are the access layer for providing data to the users.

*Data Mart* - A subset of DW, smaller DW focused on a specific area
*Strategic Mart* - a DW focused on aggregate data that will be used for determining business direction

The data is often grouped into hierarchical groups (trees) called dimensions and also into facts and aggregate facts.  The combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a star schema.

There are two main approaches to storing data in a data warehouse, the dimensional approach (Star Schema) and the normalized approach.

In a dimensional approach, transaction data are partitioned into "facts", which are generally numeric transaction data, and "dimensions", which are the reference information that gives context to the facts. 

##### Example
Facts:
- qty
- price

Dimensions:
- Order Date
- Customer
- Product
- Region
- Salesperson

##### Main Disadvantages
1. In order to maintain integrity of the facts and dimensions, loading the data is complex
2. It is difficult to modify the data warehouse structure if the organization's needs change

### Problems that Data Warehousing Attempts to solve
*Slow Data/Slow reports*
- Generation of reports should be quicker in a "Big Data" (2NF) table
- Some data might be pre-calculated or aggregated before the report is run

*Mission Level Reporting*
- Business level users require a lot of aggregation which is very processor intensive
- DW should make these kinds of queries faster

*Scalable Access*
- Simplify access to data so IT doesn't have to customize every report
- Users have functions to create their own reports and dashboards

*Multiple Versions of the Truth*
- Reports from different departments get different results
- DW Standardizes and integrates data so apples can be compared to apples
