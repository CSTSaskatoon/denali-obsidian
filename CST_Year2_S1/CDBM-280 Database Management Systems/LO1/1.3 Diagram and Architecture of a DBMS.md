When talking about DBMS architecture, we are referring to how the database is viewed by users.  Abstract views of the data are provided to the users.  These views hide how the data is stored so that the user does not need to worry about where data is located or how it’s stored.

## 3 Levels of Architecture

### External
- Most abstract
- View level
- End Users
- Doesn't know the structure of the database
- A single user may have multiple views at this level

### Conceptual
- Logical structure of the entire database and can be referred to as the logical level
- Developers/DBAs
- Describes what data is stored, relationships among data, without concern for the physical storage implementation
- Hides the complexity of physical storage structures

### Internal (Physical)
- Least abstract
- DBAs may have certain details
- Mostly managed by the DBMS
- Physical representation of the database on the computer
- Describes how the data is physically stored and organized on a storage medium
- Deals with the storage layout, performance settings, etc

### Major components of DBMS Architecture
- *DBMS External Interfaces* - A means of communication with the database to perform operations on a database and manage the DBMS
- *Database Language Engines (or processors)* - Most operations upon databases are performed through expression in Database Languages. (Ex. SQL) Expressions are interpreted to extract the meaning and intended database operations
-  *Query Optimizer* - Attempts to determine the most efficient way to execute a give query. Generates a **Query Plan**
-  *Database Engine* - Core service for storing, processing and securing data
-  *Storage Engine* - Handles the operations on the physical medium. Translates commands to low level input ouput
-  *Transaction Engine* - Tracks all of the transactions and manages their execution and concurrency control
