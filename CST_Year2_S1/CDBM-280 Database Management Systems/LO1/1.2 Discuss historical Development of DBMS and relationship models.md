## File-based systems
- First type of digital database system
- Emulated a manual filing system

### Limitations of the file based approach
*Separation and isolation of data*
- Since data was kept in separate files, it was difficult to get information out because significant processing needed to derive the information

*Duplication of data*
- Often file-based systems are built on department basis, so data is often duplicated between offices/departments
- Results in wasted time, space and loss of data integrity (information isn't up to date)

*Data dependence*
- Physical structure and and storage of data is defined by the application. Changing structure requires a lot of work

*Incompatible File Formats*
- Structure of the data is dependent on the program, usually not compatible with other systems

*Fixed Queries*
- The information that can be derived is dependent on the application developers writing code to develop the reports.
- There is no faculty to do ad-hoc reporting

Database concept started in 1960 to solve the limitations of file-based data storage
First generation was navigational, where applications accessed data by following pointers from one record to another
- Ex. Node6.Node4.Node5.Node1

### Hierarchical Model
![](Pasted%20image%2020240903093244.png)
- Still used, Ex. Windows File System and Registry
- Each record has one parent, may have many child records
- Tree based

### Network Model

- Graph based
- Allows each record to have multiple parent and child records (Many - Many)

These systems were used up until the 1980s until they were replaced with relational database systems

## Relational Database Models
- Proposed by Edgar Codd in 1970
- Specified that applications search for data by content (not following links)
- This allows the content of the database to evolve without re-writing the applications
- Primary and Foreign keys are used instead of pointers to define relationships between entities
>The use of primary and foreign keys made for a new paradigm in which searches could be conducted using a new language called SQL to search a relational database

>While the relational database is a good model for searching the content, it is less well suited for modeling the data (Giving a visual for what the data looks like).
>For this reason the **Entity-Relationship** model was proposed in 1976 - this is now the primary model for diagraming databases today.
### Advantages of RDBMS
- Control data redundancy
- Improve data integrity (Validity)
- DBMS Provide all of the file handling routines
- Improved ability to share data
- Improved security

### Disadvantages
- Complexity
- Cost of software
- High impact of failure
- Scalability (Over multiple servers)

## Object Oriented Databases
First defined in 1985, allows for data to be represented as objects (*Supposed to go along with OOP*)
Most OOD offer some kind of query language such as *Object Query Language* (*OQL*)
Since object databases store both the complex data and the relationships between data directly, without having to map to rows and columns, this allows them to work well with complex data.

>ORM (Object Relational Mapping) has diminished their popularity

### Potential Advantages
- Objects don't require assembly and disassembly saving coding time and execution time
- Easier navigation using the object hierarchy
- Concurrency control locks a hierarchy of objects rather than rows
- Data model is based on the real world
- Works well for distributed architectures
- Less code required when applications are object oriented

### Disadvantages
- Standards for RDBMS are stable with lots of documentation
- Support for RDBMS is more certain
- Relational tables are simpler to understand
- More user tools exist for RDBMS
- Lower efficiency  when data is simple and relationships are simple

## XML Databases
Data is stored in an XML format
Act more as a middleman than a database (Export your database as XML and then import it into another database)
Data can be queried, exported, and imported into the desired format.
Similar to OOD. The main purpose is to transfer data between two different environments. XML is a pretty universal format so it's exported from one DB and into another.

## NoSQL Databases
NoSQL (Not Only SQL) is the current trend mostly being utilized by the web development world.  NoSQL is used to describe the new datastores that are *non-relational*.  There are many different ways of classifying NoSQL databases such as by data model or feature.  The 4 basic categories are:

*Column* - Basically an object that consists of 3 elements (unique name, value, timestamp)
- Ex. Google Bigtable, Apache Cassandra

*Document* - Documents encapsulate and encode data. 
- Ex. MongoDB, CouchDB

*Key-Value* - Basically a map or dictionary that allows clients to put and get values per key.
- DynamoDB, Oracle NoSQL, Redis

*Graph* - A type of navigational database that employs nodes, properties and edges where the node is the entity
- Ex. Neo4j, Neptune
