## Syntax
`[]` means optional

*DDL - Data Definition Language*
- Changing the structure of the database
- Ex. ALTER, CREATE, DROP, RENAME
- Database immediately changes (implicit commit)

*DML - Data Manipulation Language*
- Manipulating the contents of the database
- Ex. Insert, Update, Delete, Select
- Must explicitly commit and save

## Data Definition Language
*CREATE TABLE Statement*
```sql
CREATE TABLE tableName {
columnName datatype [column constraint(s)]
{, columnName datatype [column constraint(s)] ... }
{, [constraints] ... }
};
```
Each column definition has 3 parts
- Name (must be unique to the table)
- Data type
- Constraints (optional)

*DROP TABLE statement*
- Deletes a table and all it's data
```sql
DROP TABLE [schema.]tableName [CASCADE CONSTRAINTS];
```

Cascade constraints
- Allows a parent table to be dropped even if a child table exists

## Oracle Data Types
A *data type* of a column specifies what kind of information will hold so that the system will know how to *physically* store the data and how it can be *manipulated*
Important to pick the right data type because it is difficult to change it later

### Number Data Types
Oracle use the **`NUMBER`** keyword for all number data types. it doesn't use **`INTEGER`** or **`INT`**, it just replaces them with *`NUMBER(38)`* which is a giant number. It also doesn't support **`DECIMAL`**, it also just uses *`NUMBER(38)`*.
- Stores negative, positive, fixed, floating point numbers between $10^{-130}$ and $10^{125}$ with precision up to 38 decimal places
- Syntax: `columnName NUMBER[( precision [, scale])]`
	- precision stores the number of digits
	- scale is the number of digits on the right side of the decimal point

#### Subtypes
*Integers*
- `columnName NUMBER(precision)`
- Ex. `NUMBER(3)` - 3 digits without decimal place (-999 to 999)
- Decimals are rounded, error guaranteed if attempting to store too large

*Fixed-point numbers*
- `columnName NUMBER(p, s)`
- Ex. `NUMBER(6,2)` - 6 digits, 4 on the left, 2 on the right

*Floating-point numbers*
- `columnName NUMBER`
- Decimal point can appear anywhere from before the last digit to after the last digit or omitted entirely

### Character Datatypes
**`CHAR`** stores fixed length, **`VARCHAR2`** stores variable length
*`CHAR`*
- `columnName CHAR[(size)]`
- Stores fixed length character data up to the size
- size default to one
- Trailing spaces are added to pad up the size if positions are blank
- More efficient than *`VARCHAR2`*

*`VARCHAR2`*
- `columnName VARCHAR2(maxSize)`
- Stores variable length character data up to the max size

*`NVARCHAR2`* and *`NCHAR`*
- Allow unicode (more than varchar2)

### Date and Time Datatypes
**`DATE`**
- `columName DATE`
- Stores data from `4712BC` to `4712AD`
- Stores century, year, month, day, hour, minute and second
- The user has a default date format set and a default time format

**`TIMESTAMP`**
- `columnName TIMESTAMP(fractional seconds precision)`
- Similar to *`DATE`* but stores a more precise fractional second
- Default is 6 decimal places

### Large Object (LOB) Datatypes
Used to store Binary data such as images, or references to binary data, or large amounts of text
Types
- **`BLOB`** - Stores up to 4GB of data in the database
- **`BFILE`** - Stores a reference to a binary file outside of the database
- **`CLOB`** - Stores up to 4GB of character data
- **`NCLOB`** - ASCII Data only

Usually wouldn't need this

## Constraints
Rules to restrict what data is allowed in a column

| Constraint Type | ID Abbreviation |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Primary Key     | PK              |
| Foreign Key     | FK              |
| Check           | cc              |
| Null / Not Null | nn              |
| Unique          | uk              |
`Use TableName_columnName_constraintIDAbbreviation`
Ex. `Project_projectID_pk`

*Two Levels*
- Table of Constraints restrict data value with respect to all other values in the table
- Column constraints limit the value that can be placed in a specific column, regardless of values in other records

Generally, you can place these each constraint at the end of the `CREATE TABLE`, or within the column definitions - some restrictions exist

### Integrity Constraints
Defines primary key columns and specifies foreign keys corresponding column references
*Primary Keys*
- Within a column definition:
	- `columnName datatype CONSTRAINT conName PRIMARY KEY`
- At the end of `CREATE`
	- `CONSTRAINT conName PRIMARY KEY (columnName)`
	- *If composite, must be declared at the end.*

*Foreign Keys*
- Within a column definition
	- `columnName datatype CONSTRAINT conName REFERENCES otherTable(columnName)`
- At the end of `CREATE`
	- `CONSTRAINT conName FOREIGN KEY (columName) REFERENCES otherTable(columnName)`

*Composite Keys*
- If a PK or FK is composite, all columns must be listed and it must be declared at the end of the CREATE
	- Ex. `CONSTRAINT conName PRIMARY KEY (col1, col2, ...)`

### Value Constraints
Column-level constraints that restrict the data values that users can enter into a given column
*Check Constraint*
- Expression that must result in true or false that data can be tested against
- Data is evaluated whenever it changes against any present check constraints
- `columnName datatype CONSTRAINT conName CHECK(expression)`
- Ex. `CHECK ((year = 1) OR (year = 2))`

*Not Null Constraint*
- Specify whether the user must enter a value or whether the value can be null (required or not)
- NULL is the default for fields except for the PK
- Must be in the column definition unless you make a CHECK for IS NOT NULL
- `columnName datatype CONSTRAINT conName NOT NULL`

*Default "constraint"*
- Specifies the default value to be used if a value is omitted in the insert statement - default default is null
- Must be defined in the column definition and as they aren't true constraints cannot be given names
- `columnName datatype DEFAULT defValue`

*Unique Constraint*
- All values in a column or set of columns must be unique
- All PKs automatically unique
- null values are allowed
- `columnName datatype CONSTRAINT conName UNIQUE`

## System Tables
*Metadata*

| Object Name         | Object Type                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `User_objects`      | All schema objects                  |
| `User_tables`       | Tables in current schema            |
| `User_indexes`      |                                     |
| `User_views`        |                                     |
| `User_constraints`  |                                     |
| `User_cons_columns` | Table columns that have constraints |
| `User_ind_columns`  | Columns with indexes                |
| `User_tab_columns`  | All Table columns                   |

## Unrestricted Actions and Restricted Actions
Depending on the situation, certain actions will be prevented.

### Modifying/Deleting Tables
*Unrestricted (can always do these)*
- Renaming a table (*doesn't change programs/reports*)
- Add new fields
- Deleting fields (Except a PK that has a FK linked to it)
- Increase the size of a field
- Delete constraints

*Restricted*
- Deleting a table - Allowed only if the table doesn't contain any fields that other tables reference in their FKs
- Changing an existing field's data type - Allowed only if existing data in the field is compatible with the new data type
- Decreasing the size of an existing field - Allowed only if the existing values are NULL
- Adding a PK constraint to existing field - Allowed only if existing values are already UNIQUE and NOT NULL
- Adding a FK constraint to existing field - Allowed only if existing values are NULL or exist in the parent table
- Adding a unique constraint - Allowed only if the existing values are already UNIQUE
- These two aren't really restricted
	- Adding a CHECK constraint - Unrestricted, but it won't use the check against existing data, only new data
	- Changing a field's default - Unrestricted, but won't change already existing data's default

### Renaming Existing Tables
Renames a table, including an internal links to it. Will not fix any outside programs/queries that used the old name
`RENAME oldTableName TO newTableName;`

### Alter Table
Alter a Table that has been created, it's structure, properties, or constraints can all be changed
Altering an empty table usually poses no difficulties - once the table has data a number of actions can be restricted.

#### Adding Fields to an existing table
Unrestricted - new values populated with null if existing rows exist
`ALTER TABLE tableName ADD(columnName datatype [constraints...]);`
parenthesis contains a column definition in the same fashion as `CREATE TABLE`

#### Deleting Fields
Many databases will also delete any constraints linked to the deleted fields
`ALTER TABLE tableName DROP COLUMN columnName;`

#### Adding/Deleting Constraints
Adding constraints is restricted (see above)
Deleting constraints is unrestricted
`ALTER TABLE tableName ADD CONSTRAINT conName columnDefinition;`
- Syntax is in the same form as if it's at the end of a `CREATE TABLE` statement

`ALTER TABLE tableName DROP CONSTRAINT conName;`

#### Modifying existing fields
Restricted action - can only modify existing fields if the current values are compatible with the change
`ALTER TABLE tableName MODIFY (columnName datatype etc...);`
- Similar to add, the parenthesis contain  a column definition
