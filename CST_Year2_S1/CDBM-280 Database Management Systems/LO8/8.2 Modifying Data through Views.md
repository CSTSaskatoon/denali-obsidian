## Terms
*Base Table(s)* - source tables (actual locations where data is)
*Key Preserved table* - a table where you can uniquely identify each row
- if you have joins, at most one of them can be key preserved
- Normally the many side of a one to many relationship
- Can also be the joining table in a many to many relationship

## ANSI Rules
A view is not updateable if it has any of the following items in the select clause

*`DISTINCT`*

An *Aggregate* or *analytical* function (`SUM`, `MAX`, etc.)
- Single row functions don't break this rule (you just can't update those fields)

*`GROUP BY`*, *`ORDER BY`*, or *`HAVING`* clause

References to more than one table (`FROM` clause, subquery, `UNION`, etc.)
- Oracle and many systems support updateable join views, with restrictions
	- Can only update one base table through the view at most
	- Must have at least one key preserved table

References to a view that is read only or non-updateable

**Bottom line: for a view to be updateable, the DBMS must be able to trace any row or column back to it's row or column in the source table**

### Creating copies
rather than create a view, which doesn't make a copy, you may want an independent copy of some data stored in a separate table
*Useful for*

### Analyzing The updatability of a join view
Consider the view
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Oaklanders AS
	SELECT aufName AS First, aulName AS Last, T.titleID, title
	FROM Author A JOIN TitleAuthor TA ON A.auID = TA.auID
		JOIN Title T ON TA.titleID = T.titleID
	WHERE city = 'Oakland' AND state = 'CA';
```

*Is this view updatable?*
Yes - `TitleAuthor` is key preserved
- Key preserved table (without regard for what I'm selecting) is a child of **BOTH** other tables (on the many side of both) and there isn't any aggegate functions/grouping/`DISTINCT`
- However, can't `INSERT` because we don't have all the required fields (`titleID` in `TitleAuthor`)
- Also can't `UPDATE` for the same reasons

Consider this view
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Oaklanders AS
	SELECT aufName AS First, aulName AS Last, TA.titleID, title
	FROM Author A JOIN TitleAuthor TA ON A.auID = TA.auID
		JOIN Title T ON TA.titleID = T.titleID
	WHERE city = 'Oakland' AND state = 'CA';
```
*We are getting the `titleID` from `TitleAuthor` instead of `Title`, which lets us `UPDATE` on ONLY `titleID` and we still can't `INSERT`*

Consider this view
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Oaklanders AS
	SELECT TA.auID, aufName AS First, aulName AS Last, TA.titleID, title, TA.auOrder
	FROM Author A JOIN TitleAuthor TA ON A.auID = TA.auID
		JOIN Title T ON TA.titleID = T.titleID
	WHERE city = 'Oakland' AND state = 'CA';
```
*Now we have all the required fields from `TitleAuthor` in the View! This means that we can finally `INSERT`, as long as we only insert fields found in the View and we are ok with having null/default values for fields not included*
