# Design Views
## What is a view?
They don't really have any data, it's basically just a saved query that runs when you interact with it
- 'virtual table' whos content is take from other tables/views

The tables we've created so far (with `CREATE TABLE`) contains data persistently stored in the database
- base tables/source tables

Once created, views can be used like a table
- Can `SELECT`, `INSERT`, etc.
- Query that makes up the view is executed whenever the view is used in such a statement

## Advantages
**Security**
- Hide things from users (limit the amount of data they actually get from a query)
- Allow the system to give different permissions to the same table

**Simplicity**
- Display results of computed columns
- Simplify queries and hide SQL syntax

**Extendibility**
- Allow the system to change without breaking how the application works

**Maintain Data Integrity**
- Allow the system to have different processing rules (via triggers) for the same table
- Triggers are basically like events for `INSERT` statements and such

## Disadvantages
**Performance**
- nested queries
- Complex queries can be run on views. Views can be created with complex queries. If this is the case, they can take a long time to run.
- Since the complexity of the view is hidden, users are not aware of the additional complexity they are creating by running queries

**Manageability**
- Views make it easy to create many different layers, adding to the complexity of the database. This can make debugging and troubleshooting difficult.

**Update Restrictions**
- More complex views and nested views may create read-only views

## How Views work
Essentially just a query with a name
When you call/use a view, you are accessing the data stored in the underlying tables
When a view is created, the `SELECT` statement isn't actually run
- `SELECT` statement runs when called, usually within another `SELECT` statement

## Creating a View
```SQL
CREATE [OR REPLACE] VIEW viewName [ ( aliases for columns ) ] AS
	SELECT statement [WITH ( READ ONLY | CHECK OPTION ) ];
```
Use *`OR REPLACE`* if you want to replace an existing view with a new `SELECT` statement
Provide aliases for columns

**`WITH READ ONLY`** means only selects are allowed against the view
- updates, inserts, and deletes aren't allowed

**`WITH CHECK OPTION`** means the user can insert, update, and delete but only those rows that are available in the view
- without the check option, the user could create a row that would not appear in the view

*Naming columns*
- Can give names to use for the columns in a list after the view name
- Can also use column aliases in `SELECT` statement

A view's `SELECT` statement can have pretty much any valid `SELECT`, but generally don't include an `ORDER BY`
- Some systems also restrict `UNION`
- Views can have `JOINS` and subqueries
- Can be derived from other views

## Dropping a View
```SQL
DROP VIEW viewName;
```
