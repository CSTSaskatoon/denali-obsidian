# Query Optimization
## Indexes
- A mechanism to boost performance. "*A logical pointer to a physical location*"
- Can be placed on a column to help the system find the data faster
- Every time data in the system is updated, any corresponding indexes have to be updated as well (done automatically by the system)

```SQL
CREATE [ UNIQUE | BITMAP ] INDEX index_name 
	ON table_name ({ column_name | column_expressions } [ ASC | DESC ] [, ...])
	[ various storage attributes ];
```

**`BITMAP` index** - works best for columns with a small set of possible values (Ex. only 3 or 4)
**`UNIQUE` index** - prevents duplication of data (system checks for duplicates when index is created and when data is added/changed. PK and UK constraints use these)

Terms
- B-tree Index - default and most common
- Clustered Index - Sorts table rows in the same physical order as the index
- Composite Index - involves more than one column (leading portion of the index is also usable for searches, say lastname, firstname)
- Function-based index - Based on a computation like `UPPER(lastname)`

### Why
#### Advantages
Speed retrieval (queries)

#### Disadvantages
it's not free to have an index (will slow down transactions if you have a lot)
building an maintaining an index takes time and storage space
Inserts, updates and deletes on indexed columns may take longer because index has to be updated in addition to the data

#### Considerations
Frequency of reads vs writes (queries vs updates)
- More indexes means faster reads and slower writes
- more tables through normalization means less redundancy but more overhead when re-joining tables
- If there are more queries than data modification, then you want to minimize the number of tables (de-normalize) and maximize the number of indexes
- Opposite is true if you have lots of transactions (normalize just enough for indexes functionality)

Likelihood that queries and updates are going to be slow
- How often the indexed column will be used in the `WHERE` or `JOIN`, among other areas
- Time vs storage space (indexes take up storage)

Whether to use special types of indexes (Ex. `BITMAP`)

### Guidelines
#### When to use
- Unique constraints/PK (often automatically done)
- FK columns
- Columns accessed in sorted order
- columns searched for range of values (cluster)

#### When NOT to use
- Columns rarely referenced in queries
- Columns with few possible values (through `BITMAP` may help)
- Small tables/few rows
- If you are often getting all of the data

## Basics of Query Optimization
SQL is **non-procedural** (you specify what you want, not how), the DBMS determines how to get the data
the DBMS has an optimizer that attempts to choose the most efficient method to execute the statement (what table to access in what order, what indexes to use, etc.)
- **Rule-based** - optimizer makes decisions based on a set of ranked guidelines (looking at what indexes are available, constraints, etc. Only considers the **structure of the schema, not the content**)
- **Cost-Based** - Chooses the cheapest option (time) based on statistics kept by the system (table size, etc.) To be effective, **statistics must be up to date**

There are ways to re-phrase some queries to improve efficiency of queries - might include very **system specific** (Oracle vs SQL Server), so check the docs
- Using tools to inspect the query optimizer's plan
- Providing "hints" to the optimizer will influence the plan it generates

### Guidelines
Adding indexes to frequently used columns will change the plan for the query if the index can be used
Try several approaches to a query and compare their plans

### Comparing Execution Plans
Oracle will generate a **Plan table**
Compare the cost of two execution plans, lower cost one is more efficient

### Tips/Rules
#### Where clauses
Use a `WHERE` clauses to filter rows (as apposed to your app filtering them after getting them from the database)
- If you're only looking for a specific row, don't ask for all of them
- Ex. `SELECT * FROM Customers` vs `SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE cNum IN (2001, 2002)`

#### Joins
IF you need information from more than one table, you should use a join rather than multiple queries (across the network)
In general it's faster to execute one complex query than several simple queries
You should join the tables such that the table with the **least number** of hits is **joined last** (Oracle's recommendation).
Avoid joining complex views in your queries as the view will run (probably slowly) followed by your query

#### Fully qualified column references when performing joins
Prevents the system from having to query the metadata by using the table aliases
Always include table aliases in the prefix for each column (**Saves the DBMS from searching the table headers/metadata to determine which table the column comes from**)
Ex.
```sql
SELECT o.oNum, c.cName FROM Customers C JOIN Orders O ON c.cNum = o.oNum WHERE c.cNum = 2004;
```

#### Indexes on tables
Indexes on FK can make a difference if the FK is often used in joins

#### Use `WHERE` instead of `HAVING`
only works if the condition doesn't have an aggregate function obviously
If the condition doesn't have an aggregate function, **there is no reason to use the `HAVING` clause**
Ex.
```sql
SELECT odate, avg(amt) FROM Orders GROUP BY oDate HAVING odate IN (TO_DATE('03-OCT-00'), TO_DATE('04-OCT-00')); -- slower
SELECT odate, avg(amt) FROM Orders WHERE odate IN (TO_DATE('03-OCT-00'), TO_DATE('04-OCT-00')) GROUP BY oDate; -- faster
```

#### use `EXISTS` rather than `IN` for correlated subqueries
Theoretically **EXISTS** can exit early once something is found whereas **IN** has to go through all the data for comparison
Use a simple subquery if possible
```sql
SELECT cNum, cName FROM Customers c_out WHERE cNum IN (SELECT * FROM Orders O WHERE o.cNum = c_out.cNum); -- slower
SELECT cNum, cName FROM Customers c_out WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Orders O WHERE o.cNum = c_out.cNum); -- faster
```
