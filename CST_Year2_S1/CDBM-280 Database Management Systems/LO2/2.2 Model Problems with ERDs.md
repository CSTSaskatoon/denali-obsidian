# Determining a Database model
### 1. Determine Entities

### 2. Define the relationships

#### Entity-relationship matrix

#### Reading the relationship
When determining the type of relationship (1-1, 1-n, or n-n) we only look at the cardinality
##### One to One

Reading left to right
- For each rank their is exactly one edition

Reading right to left
- For each edition there is exactly one rank

##### One to Many

Reading Top to Bottom
- One author has many publications

Reading from Bottom to Top
- A publication has one author

##### Many to Many

When we have a many to many relationship, it will be broken up into a joining table with two one to many relationships back to the original tables
A many to many relationship cannot be represented in a typical relational database

##### Modality (0 or 1)

### Practice
#### `Student ||--|| Seat`
- Modality - 1 (Required)
- Cardinality - 1 (Max 1)
- Relationship - 1:1

#### `Instructor ||--{| Course`
- Instructor - c:1 m:1
- Course - c:many m:1
- One to many

#### Add attributes and keys

Each entity requires a primary key, all relationships require foreign keys
Each relationship should be defined for cardinality/modality

### Formalize and review the diagram to ensure it's normalized
*Do any attributes have multiple values for a single instance of an entity?*
- Yes - move the repeating attributes/groups
- No - The data is in 1NF

*Is the identifier comprised of more than 1 attribute? If so, are any attribute values dependent on just part of the identifier?*

*Do any attribute values depend on an attribute that is not the identity's identifier?*

#### 1NF

#### 2NF
*No partial dependencies on a composite key. This means all attributes must depend on all parts of the composite key*

primary key is (`OrderID`, `ItemID`)
The attribute that depends on `OrderID` is moved to a new entity

#### 3NF
*No dependencies on non-key attributes. Attributes should only be dependent on the Primary key.*

Some relations generated above may be dropped due to duplication
Check joining tables to make sure the created entities don't break any business rules
