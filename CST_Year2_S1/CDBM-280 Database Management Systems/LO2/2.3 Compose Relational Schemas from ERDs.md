## Steps
### 1. Ensure the diagram is normalized (Finished/complete)
*For each weak entity (weak entity to strong entity, usually a joining table)*
- Convert to a strong entity by adopting keys of each entity to which is related
- The primary key is a combination of adopted (Foreign keys) and any existing key attributes of the weak entity
- May also instead use a generated primary key (Such as LoanID, etc.)

*For many-to-many relationships (N:M)*
- Create a new relationship with two 1:N relationships
- new relationship will have a composite key of the key fields from existing parent relations
- If the relationship attributes, those attributes should be added to the new relation as well

*Review and Consolidate*

### 2. For each entity (Entities to Relations)
- Create a relation with the same name and set of attributes
- If an attribute is composite you should divide it into multiple pieces. Key of the entity will become the key of the relation
	- *in practice, this is often name and address (Name becomes firstName/lastName for example)*

### 3. For Each Relationship (Relationships to Relations) or each FK
*For a One to One Relationship (1:1)*
- Take the key from either relation and place it as a foreign key in the other. You should place the foreign key into the relation where it will have the fewest null values

*For a One to Many Relationship (1:N)*
- Take the key from the parent (One side) and place it as a foreign key in the child (Many side)

### 4. Final Schema
- List the relation names and attributes in the form
	- RelationName(attribute1, attribute2, attribute3(fk), ...)
	- List all referential integrity constraints for foreign key and unique attributes
		- In the form: attribute3 references OtherRelation(attributeXYZ)

## Example 1

### 1. Normalize
*Make weak entities strong*
- Faculty needs a foreign key to Department
- Student needs a FK to Faculty
- Student needs a FK to Major
- Major needs a FK to Department

*Many to many relations*
- Section: sectionNum, credit, room, time
- Grade: gradeAchieved

*Review and consolidate*
- Section needs PK/FK to Faculty and Course
- Grade needs PK/FK to Section and Student
- *You might decide that grade needs a surrogate key*

### 2. For each entity
- Faculty (facultyID, firstName, lastName, position, deptNumber(fk))
- Department (deptNumber, name, streetNo, city, prov, postalCode)
- Course (courseNumber, name)
- Student (studentID, firstName, lastName, streetNo, city, prov, postalCode, majorID(fk))
- Major (majorID, name, description, deptNumber(fk))
- Section (facultyID(fk), courseNumber(fk), sectionNum, cred, room, time)
- Grade

### 3. Document Relationships
**I don't have enough time to write all this**
"teach" N:M relationship
- Section (facultyID(fk)) references Faculty(facultyID)
- Section(CourseNumber(fk)) references Course (coureNumber)

### 4. Final Schema
**I don't have enough time to write all this, but put it all together**

## Example 2

### Normalize
*Make weak entities strong*
- CardAccount needs FK to Customer
- DebitCard needs FK to CardAccount
- CreditCard needs FK to CardAccount

*Many to Many Relationships*
- Add a Charges table
	- Charges: date, amount

*Review and Consolidate*
- Charges needs a FK to both Merchant and CreditCard
- Charges needs a PK transactionID
- DebitCard and CreditCard can both use accountNo as their PK

### For Each Entity
Customer (custID(PK), custFirstName, custLastName, streetNo, city, prov, postalCode)
CardAccount (accountNo(PK), expireDate(FK), custID(FK))
Merchant (merchantID(PK), merchStreet, merchCity, merchProv, merchPostalCode)
DebitCard (AccountNo(PK, FK), bankNo)
Charges (transactionID(PK), merchantID(FK), accountNo(FK), date, amount)
CreditCard (accountNo(PK, FK), currentBalance)

### Document Relations
"Owns" 1:N Relationship

### Final Schema
Customer (custID(PK), custFirstName, custLastName, streetNo, city, prov, postalCode)
CardAccount (accountNo(PK), expireDate(FK), custID(FK))
Merchant (merchantID(PK), merchStreet, merchCity, merchProv, merchPostalCode)
DebitCard (AccountNo(PK, FK), bankNo)
Charges (transactionID(PK), merchantID(FK), accountNo(FK), date, amount)
CreditCard (accountNo(PK, FK), currentBalance)

## Example 3

### Final Schema
Branch (branchName(PK))

Catalogue Item (itemID(PK), branchName(FK), callNumber(FK), copyNumber, circulationStatus)
- CatalogueItem(branchName(FK)) references Branch(branchName)
- CatalogueItem(callNumber(FK)) references Book(callNumber)

Book (callNumber(PK), title, auFName, auLName)
- Book(itemID(FK)) references CatalogueItem(itemID)
- Book(patronID(FK)) references Paton(patronID)

Book Loan (takeOutNum(PK), itemID(FK), dueDate, returnDate, patronID(FK))

Patron (patronID(PK), firstName, lastName, streetNo, city, prov, postalCode)
