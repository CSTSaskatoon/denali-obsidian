# ERD Review
*Entity* - Anything that can have an independent existence that be uniquely identified. An abstraction of the complexities found in some real world situation.
Cardinality/Modality are indicators of business rules around a relationship
*Cardinality* - How many instances of one entity relate to another
*Modality/Ordinality* - Describes the relationship as either optional or mandatory (Minimum number of related instances, either 0 or 1)
![](Pasted%20image%2020240910080748.png)
Cardinality is always on the outside, Modality on the inside
*Zero or more*
