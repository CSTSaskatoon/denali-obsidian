>Class of objects bound by values it represents and set of operations.

The Abstract is NOT how it works in that background or how it is stored, just using it is important. Think of encapsulations and information hiding. These are more like interfaces in Java.
Once it is implemented, then it is a *data structure*, what kind of code will work with it.

Data structure can be implemented.
This is what can actually be created and used in code.

Algorithm are well made instructions to make something.

Will be using C#, which is a lot like Java but a little less verbose.
This is OOP, but can be used for procedural programming.
Once was *.NET* made by Microsoft that is cross-platform.
Like how Java using a **JVM** to run *Bytecode*, this take C# into *CIL* (Common Intermediate Language) and ran in a virtual machine called **CLR** (Common Language Runtime).
## Lightweight Editor - Notepad :)
Later, we will use Visual Studio.

Can only run code from:
`C:sourcecode`
