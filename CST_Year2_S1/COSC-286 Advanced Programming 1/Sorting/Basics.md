### Bubble Sort
Easy to implement
Not very efficient

### Quicksort
Similar to Binary Search Trees
- Root splits the elements into two sub-trees
	- left sub tree has elements less than the root value, right subtree has elements greater than root node
	- A BST is an implementation of a divide and conquer approach to sorting the left and right subtrees

**Algorithm**
1. Choose a pivot
2. Move the pivot to the last position or otherwise get it out of the way
3. Partition the array relative to the pivot
4. Place the pivot value in it's place (partition index)
5. Place the pivot value in it's place (partition index)
6. some other stuff
