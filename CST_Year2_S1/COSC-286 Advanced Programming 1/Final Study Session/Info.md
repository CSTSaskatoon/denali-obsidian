## Exam notes
Theory section and Written section average student should be able to finish it in 2.5 hours but given 4.5
30% from before midterm, 70% post midterm (Graphs, sorting)

**Written**
20+ theory questions

**Coding** 
4-6 questions 3 broad categories:
- In our graph class, write a function that does x, subclass the BST to do it slightly different (different add method) 
- If you see one where a data structure/algorithm isn't specified then assume you have to figure out what one to use 
- working with the concepts we did in class, but not the code (think about the `mergeTree()` method on the midterm)

## Todo

**Tonight**
- [ ] Traversals of BST
- [ ] Rotations of BST
- [ ] Hash tables? (Maybe just the PowerPoint)

**Tomorrow Night**
- [ ] Sorting Algorithms
- [ ] Big O Notation
- [ ] Graphs
