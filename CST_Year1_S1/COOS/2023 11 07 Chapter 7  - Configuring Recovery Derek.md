Disaster Recovery
	How do you get back to normal if your system blows up?
	Plan?
		Recovery is planned and practiced
		includes prevention and response
	what is YOUR plan? The average home owner should have this taken care of
	If X happens, what is your response and how long will it take?
		needs to be tested
	Need to identify and assess Xs

Understanding Recovery
	Prevention
		Keep your PC up to date
		Use current software to scan for malware
		Perform regular Admin functions (Monitor logs in even viewer)
		Perform regular backups
	Response
		Recover the data
		return system to a safe, stable state

A Plan
	Contains several items
		Risk assessment - what can happen
		Baseline - what is normal?
		Mitigation steps - prevention, data backup
		Recover process - steps executed in case of incident (one process for each risk)
	If you don't have  a plan you will likely have data loss

Prevention
	Keep windows up to date
	a typical controlled setup will not run automatically but allow updates to be pushed at down times (at night)
	Ensure threat protection is properly configured (windows firewall, account protection, app and browser control, device security, device performance and health)

Backups and imaging
	Backups
		Backup and restore
		File-by-file
	Imaging
		System restore points
		Recovery drive 
		Block-level copying (Not in terms of individual files)

Configure buttons for system protection
	Use system properties to make restore points - doesn't copy everything, just a snapshot of the system configuration

Backup Types
	full backup - backs up everything
	Incremental Backup - backs up everything that has changed since the last incremental backup
	Differential Backup - backs up everything that has changed since the last full backup
