Remote Access Policies
	Ensure remote devices and network connections do not create vulnerabilities
	Malware protection and patching of remote hosts
	Protection of credentials
	Protection for data processed off-site
	Treat remote hosts and networks as non-trusted

Common Agreements
	Service level Agreements (SLA) requirements
	non-disclosure agreement (NDA)
		legal basis for protecting information assets
		used in employment contracts between companies
	Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)

Badges and Site Secure Entry Systems (Physical Security)
	Access Control Reader (Badge Reader, Biometric) - useful cause can disable specific people's access quickly, can monitor who goes in and out at what time
	Access Control Vestibule
		Prevent tailgating and piggybacking
		Turnstile
		"Mantrap"

Physical security for Server systems
	Locking racks (Lock whole rack or bracket/shelf locks)
	Locking cabinets
	Smart Lockers
		Smart card/biometric lock
		Sensors to detect add/remove

Detection-based Devices
	Surveillance systems and security guards
	Cameras
		Fixed vs pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ)
		Focal length
		Closed circuit television (CCTV) coax networks
		IP camera data and PoE networks
	Asset tags
		Link asset to database/configuration management
		Radio Frequency ID (RFID) monitored tags

Alarms and tamper detection
	Alarm types
		Circuit/tamper detection
		Motion detection
	Alarms for rack systems and chassis intrusion
	Tamper detection for cabling
		Physically secure cabled network is referred to as a protected distribution system (PDS)

Asset disposal
	Factory reset/configuration wipe
		Remove accounts and passwords
		Remove configuration information
		Remove licensing keys and registration
	Data remnants and media sanitization
		Physical destruction
		Overwriting and HDDs versus SSDs
		Secure Erase (SE)
		Instant Secure Erase (ISE)

Employee Training
	Security Awareness
		Incident reporting
		Site security
		Data and credential handling
		social engineering, malware, and other threat awareness
	Role based training

Internet of Things
	the global network of personal devices, home appliances, home control systems, vehicles, anything that can be connected to the internet with some kind of sensor
	Consumer-grade smart devices (Hub vs device functions)
	Physical Access Control Systems and smart buildings
		A network of monitored locks, intruder alarms, and video surveillance cameras
		Smart building for offices, and datacenters can include Physical Access Control System (PACS), but also network-based configuration and monitoring of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), fire control, power and lighting, and elevators and escalators, etc.

ICS/SCADA
	Industrial control systems (ICS) provides mechanisms for workflow and process automation
	Workflow and process automation systems
		Power suppliers, water suppliers, health services, telecommunications, and national security services
		Devices have a programmable logic controller (PLC)
		Mechanical devices and sensors
		Human-machine Interface (HMI)
	Supervisory Control and Data acquisition (SCADA)
		ICS distributed over large areas
		control software running on PC

IoT networks
	Operational Technology networks (No internet access)
	Cellular networks
		Specialized low-latency versions of 4G/5G
		Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) - refers to low-power version of the LTE or 4G standard
			Greater penetrating power
	Z-Wave and Zigbee
		wireless network for home devices

Placement and Security
	Consumer-grade smart devices
		Vendor assessment
		Risks from shadow IT where employees deploy a network-enabled device without going through a change and configuration management process
	Smart Buildings
		Isolate management traffic from the rest
