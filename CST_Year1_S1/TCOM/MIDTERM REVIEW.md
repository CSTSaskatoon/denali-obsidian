Communication Process Worksheet
	Sender
		The person who sends the message
		Ex. the speaker or writer has an idea to communicate, they think about what they want and encode it into words
	Receiver
		The person who receives the message and decodes it by reading, listening or observing
	Encode
		Deciding what you want to say and how you will convey it
	Message
		The ideas, feelings, or picture the sender wants to convey
	Channel
		The method used to send the message (Speech, writing, email, flowers)
	Decode
		Receiver trying to understand the meaning of the message
	Noise
		1. External (Physical) noise - Factors outside a receiver that make it difficult to hear or see the. (Heat, smoke, loud noises, etc.)
		2. Physiological Noise - Biological factors such as illness, being hungry or tired
		3. Psychological Noise - Forces within a communicator that interfere with their ability to express or understand a message accurately (Voices in your head, being distracted)
	Environment
		Physical location and personal experiences/background (Ethnicity, class, occupation, etc.)
	Feedback
		Discernable verbal or nonverbal response of a receiver to a sender's message
	Behaviour
		Deliberate (decoding) and unintentional actions (facial expressions) that can observed and decoded.

PowerPoint Summerizations
	10 - Effective verbal communication
		Semantics
			Semantics is when we assign meaning to a word
			Sometimes words mean different things in different contexts, or how you order your words can change what they mean
			Grammer can also dramatically change the meaning of words
				Examples
					1. Dear John, I want a man who knows what love is all about. You are generous, kind, thoughtful. People who are not like you admit to being useless and inferior. You have ruined me for other men. I yearn for you. I have no feelings whatsoever when we’re apart. I can be forever happy—will you let me be yours? Mary
					2. Dear John, I want a man who knows what love is. All about you are generous, kind, thoughtful people, who are not like you. Admit to being useless and inferior. You have ruined me. For other men, I yearn. For you, I have no feelings whatsoever. When we’re apart, I can be forever happy. Will you let me be? Yours, Mary
			Relative words - words that you don't know exactly what they mean until you have something to compare them to (large, small, easy, hard, fast, slow)
			Static Evaluation - When our opinions of someone don't change. (Is Joe ALWAYS a cool guy?)
			Abstract Language - opposite of specific, verbal shorthand
			Behavioural language - specific things people do or say, observable facts ("I noticed you came in to work late today")
			Euphemisms - replace harsh words for nice ones ("Killed in action", instead of "stepped onto a landmine and there is no body")
			Emotive language - purposefully arouses a feeling of emotion (You should recycle that because it will save the planet)
			Jargon - slang, words that are used in specific groups ("He's one shot")
			Perceptual Errors occur when we confuse fact, inference and judgement
				facts
					"It's raining"
				Inference - conclusion based on the facts, may or may not be true
					"It's raining" (fact) "so we will get wet" (inference)
				Judgement - an opinion, based on beliefs, values, biases
					One person thinks the weather is great, another one doesn't
			Cultural Influences
				Low context cultures (Canada, US, Britain) - Direct expression of thoughts and feelings
				High context cultures (Japan, China, Brazil) - language is used to maintain social harmony, more ambiguous
	11 - Effective Nonverbal Communication
		Verbal and vocal communication
			Vocal - sounds
			Verbal - words, whether spoken or written
			Vocal Verbal Communication - Spoken words
			Non-vocal verbal communication - Written words
			Vocal Non-verbal communications - sighs, screams, loudness, groans
			Non-vocal non-verbal communication - Body movements, facial expression, etc.
